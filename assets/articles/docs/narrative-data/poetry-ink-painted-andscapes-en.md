&emsp;&emsp;**水墨江山**
&emsp;&emsp;**Ink-painted Landscapes**

&emsp;&emsp;早春踏歌，
&emsp;&emsp;Treading through early spring,
&emsp;&emsp;望烟江叠嶂。
&emsp;&emsp;Gazing at misty waves and layered peaks.

&emsp;&emsp;富春山居，
&emsp;&emsp;Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains,
&emsp;&emsp;瞰千里江山。
&emsp;&emsp;A thousand miles of rivers unfold.

&emsp;&emsp;松崖客话，
&emsp;&emsp;Conversing under pine cliffs,
&emsp;&emsp;品深堂琴趣。
&emsp;&emsp;Savoring the zither in deep halls.

&emsp;&emsp;清溪渔隐，
&emsp;&emsp;A fisherman hidden by clear streams,
&emsp;&emsp;赏疏林远岫。
&emsp;&emsp;Admiring sparse woods and distant hills.

&emsp;&emsp;钩勒落皴，
&emsp;&emsp;Lines traced and textures stroked—
&emsp;&emsp;山高水远。
&emsp;&emsp;Mountains soar, waters flow deep.

&emsp;&emsp;心师造化，
&emsp;&emsp;The heart takes Nature as its master;
&emsp;&emsp;澄怀味象。
&emsp;&emsp;A pure mind tastes the essence of form.

&emsp;&emsp;钱塘观潮，
&emsp;&emsp;Watching the tide at Qiantang,
&emsp;&emsp;感鹊华秋色。
&emsp;&emsp;Autumn hues upon the Que and Hua.

&emsp;&emsp;溪山行旅，
&emsp;&emsp;Travelers among streams and peaks,
&emsp;&emsp;叹潇湘奇观。
&emsp;&emsp;Marveling at the wonders of Xiao and Xiang.

&emsp;&emsp;雪江归棹，
&emsp;&emsp;Returning by boat through snowy rivers,
&emsp;&emsp;听万壑松风。
&emsp;&emsp;Pines sighing in a myriad valleys.

&emsp;&emsp;山溪待渡，
&emsp;&emsp;Waiting for the ferry by the creek,
&emsp;&emsp;寻辋川故人。
&emsp;&emsp;Seeking an old friend at Wangchuan.

&emsp;&emsp;丹青泼洒，
&emsp;&emsp;Splashed colors,
&emsp;&emsp;水墨恣意。
&emsp;&emsp;Ink roaming wild.

&emsp;&emsp;千年传奇，
&emsp;&emsp;A thousand-year legend,
&emsp;&emsp;跃然纸上。
&emsp;&emsp;Leaping to life upon the paper.
