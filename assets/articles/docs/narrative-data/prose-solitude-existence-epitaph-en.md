&emsp;&emsp;Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not...

&emsp;&emsp;—— *The Old Testament*

&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps the history of life’s evolution is the history of the growth of loneliness. From the moment the first single-celled organism appeared, individual life was destined for a fate of solitude, for a relatively closed and autonomous metabolic system had finally emerged in this world. Yet, after all, any living individual remains a part of nature, governed by its laws and connected universally to all things; thus, loneliness is always relative. In this world, humans are the only creatures who experience loneliness so deeply (assuming no other intelligent life lurks among us). This is not only because we realize we come into and leave this world utterly alone, but more so because we have finally begun to perceive our own infinitesimal place within the vast universe.

&emsp;&emsp;The loneliness of some individuals is so profound that they begin to find existence absurd, even longing to relinquish their own being to escape it. Byron went to the battlefield, embracing death to finally forget loneliness in the extinction of consciousness. Taoism pursues the realm of "Oneness between Heaven and Man," yet the path to this state is "discarding sageliness and abandoning wisdom." This return to a "natural state" allows one to forget existence in a state of chaotic consciousness, thereby erasing the alienated sense of loneliness. Schopenhauer’s philosophy sought to prove the meaninglessness of existence, calling upon us to renounce it through asceticism.

&emsp;&emsp;Unlike the tragedy of biological extinction caused by harsh external environments, the sublation of existence by humans—driven by the rise of self-awareness—is a total betrayal of nature.

&emsp;&emsp;Existence may be absurd, but humanity has never been able to falsify its meaning. Moreover, the desire to survive always occupies the vast majority of souls. Thus, Sisyphus will continue to push his stone up the mountain, watch it roll down, and push it up again, day after day, year after year, with no end in sight. Estragon and Vladimir have never given up their wait for Godot.

&emsp;&emsp;Regarding the Chinese custom of not mentioning death, I am reminded of Mr. Lu Xun’s essay *Making a Point* (Lì Lùn), which on the surface tears apart the valueless things in life for all to see, but at its core, destroys the valuable things in life before our eyes—humorous, sharp, and satirical, yet carrying a profound sense of desolation.

&emsp;&emsp;If death is not the sole reason for the existence of philosophy, it is at least one of the most significant.

&emsp;&emsp;The epitaph that left the deepest impression on me is that of Immanuel Kant: *Zwei Dinge erfüllen das Gemüt mit immer neuer und zunehmender Bewunderung und Ehrfurcht, je öfter und anhaltender sich das Nachdenken damit beschäftigt: Der bestirnte Himmel über mir, und das moralische Gesetz in mir.* (I do not know German). The English translation is: "Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the more often and steadily we reflect upon them: the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me."

&emsp;&emsp;The starry sky above us is the symbol of truth. In Kant, the persistent spirit of seeking truth and the consciousness of moral self-reflection are unified. We can see this unity in many great figures. As Albert Einstein said in his tribute to Marie Curie: "In a time like ours, when we are through with the life-work of such a sublime personality as Marie Curie, let us not be satisfied with merely recalling the contributions her work has made to humanity. The moral qualities of a leading personality are perhaps of even greater significance for a generation and for the course of history than purely intellectual accomplishments. Even these latter are, to a greater degree than is usually realized, dependent upon the stature of character."

&emsp;&emsp;But clearly, not everyone dedicated to truth possesses a strong sense of moral self-reflection. If the motivation for exploring truth stems from curiosity, then how is the consciousness of moral self-reflection formed? Uncle Li Miao, what are your thoughts on this?

&emsp;&emsp;I had already prepared my will long ago. After reading Uncle Li Miao's journal today, I have also thought of an epitaph for myself:

&emsp;&emsp;*Here lies merely an insignificant Homo sapiens.*
