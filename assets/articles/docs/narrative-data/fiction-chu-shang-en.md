The scholar Liu Rui, courtesy name Minghuai, was a native of Qiantang. Born into a family of distinguished literati, he was brilliant from childhood—well-versed in the classics, skilled in music, and gifted in poetry. He was a dashing and elegant youth of refined character.

One late spring morning, carrying his zither and accompanied by his young servant, he wandered to the Yunqi Bamboo Path. There, he happened upon a woman dressed in yellow sitting beneath the bamboo. Her leg was injured, rendering her unable to move. She introduced herself as Chu Shang, a resident from the foot of Wuyun Mountain who had been injured while out for a spring stroll. Being a man of honor and possessing some medical knowledge, Minghuai gathered local herbs to treat her wound. As she could not walk, he instructed his servant to assist her to the Xixin Pavilion to rest.

Grateful for his help, the woman inquired about his identity, to which Minghuai answered fully. Their conversation soon turned to the beauty of landscapes and the depths of literature. Minghuai found her exceptionally intelligent, possessing insights far beyond the ordinary. Observing her refined grace and exquisite attire, he realized she was no mere village girl. Yet, when he pressed for details about her family, she grew evasive, stirring a flicker of suspicion in his heart.

Nonetheless, their rapport was so profound they felt like lifelong soulmates. Time slipped away unnoticed until evening fell. To mark their meeting, Minghuai took up his zither to see her off, playing the classic melody "High Mountains and Flowing Water." The music echoed through the mountains. Suddenly, the woman rose to dance. Her movements were light and ethereal, drifting like a mist and fluttering like a mayfly—a dance that seemed not of the mortal world.

Minghuai was struck with wonder, yet worried for her injury. Just as he moved to speak, she suddenly collapsed. Casting aside formal etiquette, Minghuai rushed to support her. In his arms, she softly recited:

In late spring’s grace, through Yunqi I roam, 
Where Xixin’s spring flows clear as foam. 
Ancient trees reach to pierce the blue,  
While emerald ferns the earth imbue. 
Though withered leaves fall year by year, 
Fresh bamboo shoots from rain appear. 
Where does the deep, veiled bamboo path lead? 
To the temple where old friends sleep in the reed.

Minghuai was struck with astonishment. This was a poem he had composed and recited to himself three years ago while wandering Wuyun Mountain; he had never shared it with another soul. "How do you know these words?" he cried.

The woman replied, "Do you still remember the tiny mayfly larva you saved beneath Xixin Pavilion three years ago?" Minghuai was speechless with shock.

"To meet you again today is my greatest fortune," she continued. "I am a mayfly who has practiced cultivation for a hundred years, hoping to one day transcend into immortality. Three years ago, you saved my life, and I have since adored your talent and longed for you day and night. Knowing we might never meet again, I chose to 'feather' into this human form today just to see you. I wished to stay by your side forever, to watch the seasons turn and the flowers bloom and fade—but alas, life is cruelly short."

As she finished speaking, she closed her eyes. Her body grew light as a feather, transforming into shimmering dust that scattered and glowed brilliantly in the setting sun. As Minghuai watched the dust drift away, he looked down at his palm. There lay a small, lifeless mayfly.

Human life is like that of a mayfly: born at dawn and dying at dusk. In the blink of an eye, all that remains are the vestiges of the past.
