　　*(Note: This essay is a product of my early years, during a bout of what I call "Saint Mother Complex"—looking back, it seems excessively sentimental. Correspondingly, my score on the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) is a flat zero.)*

　　I remember Tatyana Tolstaya recalling her father, Leo Tolstoy: "Once at Yasnaya Polyana, on a sudden whim, Father asked everyone to name three wishes for their life. He came up with two: to love everyone, and to be loved by everyone."
— Epigraph

　　Everyone has love. It is said that 95% of songs are about love, yet the world often possesses only "petty love" (Xiao Ai), lacking "great love" (Da Ai).

　　Love manifests in many forms: the love between partners, the love of kin, the bonds of friendship, the connection between teacher and student, and the devotion to one’s country.

But there is another kind of love—a Universal Love. Its object is all of humanity, even all of creation. It is a transcendental love that defies the boundaries of time and space. Animals do not possess universal love; they have only reproductive instincts. Pascal said: "Thought makes the greatness of man." Only sentient, thinking beings possess love because love is an abstract concept. Only a life capable of abstract thought can truly experience it.

　　Yet, universal love does not belong to every human being. It is not an instinct, but rather an enlightenment that borders on the ultimate.

Only those who realize the divinity inherent in sentient life can possess a heart of universal love, for it springs from human divinity. More often than not, however, man’s animality—his base nature—masks this divinity, giving rise to evil. Jesus, seeing the original sin of humanity through his love for all, came into this world to save all living beings, only to be betrayed by that very evil.

　　The breadth of universal love is as vast as the sea and as high as the firmament. A person of universal love does not necessarily need to perform world-shaking deeds; more often, it is a state of mind—subtle and lingering like the fragrance of fine tea. It is a "realm of existence." Because it does not stem from instinct, it is not a natural state but a spiritual one. A heart that loves all people and all things merges with nature itself; universal love is a state of being in harmony with Heaven.

Universal love belongs to the metaphysical soul. In the lives of the ignorant, divinity is absent from the stage, leaving only a succession of utilitarian, mundane, and rigid dramas devoid of great love. But the metaphysical person discards worldly prejudice and flattery, avoids the temptations of desire, and lives an examined life. He thinks, he suffers, and he loves.

　　The person of universal love is a lonely person. He loves everyone but will not be loved by everyone in return. Yet, he is willing. Even if he were loved by all, his heart would remain as steady as a deep sea; he loves all without the expectation of reciprocity. Metaphysical loneliness is incurable; it can only be liberated through universal love.

When a soul filled with universal love gazes up at the brilliant starry sky, he recognizes his own smallness and insignificance, and a sense of reverence is born within him.

As the epitaph of the great philosopher Immanuel Kant—who loved all of humanity—reads:

　　"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe, the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them: the starry heavens above and the moral law within."

　　He is but a speck of dust in the vast universe, yet his universal love makes him truly great.

　　A person of true universal love, from the day they decide to love all, will continue to do so until they depart this world—until they can no longer think and lose the right to love. One who truly possesses universal love will never regress into "petty love." Just as in Plato’s "Allegory of the Cave," once a person has stepped out of the cave, they can never again be deceived by the shadows within.
