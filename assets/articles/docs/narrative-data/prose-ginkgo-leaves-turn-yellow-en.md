　　The west wind of early winter, cold and melancholic, stings the sentimental soul. Even the sensitive ginkgo leaves seem infected by this wintry air; almost overnight, they have changed their countenance.

　　It is the season when the ginkgo leaves turn gold.

　　The yellow of the ginkgo is a singularly pure hue—a saturated, radiant medium-yellow. It is not the pale, sickly cream of some, nor the decadent, earthy ochre or brownish-tan of many deciduous trees in autumn. The yellow of the ginkgo is flawless, with leaves rarely marred by tears or sickly withered spots. Each leaf is fan-shaped, yet it avoids rigid, geometric lines; instead, it possesses graceful curves akin to a butterfly’s wings. The veins radiate outward—a feature starkly different from fellow gymnosperms like pines and cypresses.

　　The breakdown of chlorophyll in the ginkgo leaves signals that the day they must depart from their branches is drawing near. The leaves gently detach from their nodes and drift with the wind, as lithe and graceful as butterflies. The trajectories they carve through the air are elegant and fluid, fleeting though the process may be. When a strong gale blows, vast clouds of leaves are forced from the branches that once provided them with nutrients and hormones. They fall in a soughing shower like golden rain—a sight of such magnificent beauty.

　　As the leaves fall one by one, the paths become gilded carpets. I cannot bear to tread upon their fragile bodies; the rustling sound beneath one's feet is like the sobbing of autumn. Should it rain, the fallen leaves, bound by the surface tension of water, lie flat against the earth like beautiful patterns inlaid upon cobblestone paths. Or perhaps, veiled beneath a layer of water, they reveal even more vivid colors through the play of total internal reflection.

　　Gazing at these yellowing leaves so thick with the essence of autumn, I suddenly wonder: has anyone else been as startled by this dazzling yellow as I am—throughout these 345 million long years? If so, it would not have been the hulking reptiles, nor the frail small mammals hiding in the undergrowth. If so, it must have been creatures possessed of a soul that can be moved by nature. Perhaps only Homo Sapiens—the intelligent life forms procreating generation after generation on this ancient, great, yet insignificant planet—would pause their busy bodies, weary from the constant struggle for survival, to gaze at the miraculous creations of nature, immersing themselves in this momentary intuition until all else is forgotten.

　　Eventually, all the ginkgo leaves will have fallen, and the bitter winter will arrive. Next spring, new tender buds will grow again. Thus, day after day, year after year, the ginkgo tree cycles through its life, until its very vitality withers away.

　　Though the sunlight is warm and bright, for some reason, I cannot help but feel a slight chill. I recall feeling this same way when I was first struck by the overwhelming array of books on a massive counter in a large city bookstore and spotted one that caught my eye—it was likely Unamuno’s The Tragic Sense of Life.

　　I pick up a ginkgo leaf that is about to be buried by the soil and press it into the book I have with me. Let it serve as a witness to this mood of mine, which will, in time, also be buried by the years.
