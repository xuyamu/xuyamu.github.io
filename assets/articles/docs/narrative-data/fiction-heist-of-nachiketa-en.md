&emsp;&emsp;When Nachiketa opened his eyes, he found himself lying upon the earth. Before him stretched an infinite sea of flowers—vividly red and entirely devoid of leaves. He felt as though he had seen these blossoms before in some botanical manual, yet the memory eluded him.

&emsp;&emsp;"Where am I?" he murmured to himself. "I remember I was just revisiting the Metaphysics... how did I suddenly end up in such a strange place?"

&emsp;&emsp;As he raised his head, he glimpsed a figure standing a short distance away, though its features remained blurred and indistinct.

&emsp;&emsp;"Who are you?" Nachiketa called out toward the figure.

&emsp;&emsp;The figure drew closer until it stood directly before him, yet Nachiketa still could not discern its face.

&emsp;&emsp;"Who are you? And where is this?" Nachiketa asked, struggling to pull himself to his feet.

&emsp;&emsp;"I am Yama, the King of Death," the hazy silhouette replied. "And this is the Netherworld."

&emsp;&emsp;"What? Does this mean... I am dead?" Nachiketa asked in astonishment.

&emsp;&emsp;"Yes. You reached a great age, and your body was burdened with many ailments."

&emsp;&emsp;"So, I have finally left that world behind," Nachiketa mused. "Since you are Yama, you must possess great wisdom. May I ask you a few questions?"

&emsp;&emsp;"You may," Yama replied. "However, before you ask, you must walk through this sea of Equinox flowers. As you cross this field, the memories of your past lives will return to you. I shall wait for you at the horizon’s edge."

&emsp;&emsp;"Very well! I am quite curious to know the memories of my previous incarnations."

&emsp;&emsp;As Nachiketa stepped into the sea of flowers, a memory suddenly sparked: he had once read about these blooms in a tattered, ancient book in an old library. Manjusaka—the celestial flower of the underworld that lights the path to the "other shore."

&emsp;&emsp;As he began to walk, a torrent of thoughts flooded his mind.

&emsp;&emsp;Nachiketa had no idea how many past lives he had lived; they were seemingly innumerable. Memories of his previous existences flashed through his mind with lightning speed...

&emsp;&emsp;In one life, he was a placozoon, shifting his simple form and drifting with the currents, only to be swallowed by a predator and torn into fragments.

&emsp;&emsp;In another life, he was a spike moss, clinging to the earth.

&emsp;&emsp;In another, he was a firefly, casting a brilliant glow into the dark of night, eventually surrendering his life to his mate—sacrificing his physical form so that the next generation might be born.

&emsp;&emsp;He had been a slave.

&emsp;&emsp;He had been a merchant.

&emsp;&emsp;He had been a king...

&emsp;&emsp;And in his final life, he had become a philosopher.

&emsp;&emsp;Note: Nachiketa is the protagonist of the Katha Upanishad, in which he engages in a famous dialogue with Yama, the God of Death.
