The horizon devours the glory of the setting sun, 
I wander the shoreline all alone. 
Longing to share this final radiance with you, 
Yet your distant shore remains unseen.

I cannot pierce the vastness of 93 billion light-years, 
Or cease to sigh for life’s fragile, weathered years. 
Through countless days and nights, 
The time spent missing you, Is so very long.

We gaze upon the selfsame starry sphere, 
With the despair of Shen and Shang, never to meet. 
Finding no glimmer of hope, 
I walk through the abyss of the night.

Time erodes countless joys and griefs, 
I cannot help but fall into deep melancholy. 
Finding no ultimate answer, 
All things turn absurd.

The past dissolves like mist and rain, 
Life is as brief as a dream. 
I cannot hide the desolation, 
Wandering endlessly in the void.

If madness be my final end, 
Please let me sleep forever in the wilds. 
May you walk into my graveyard, 
And tread upon the soil that buries me.
