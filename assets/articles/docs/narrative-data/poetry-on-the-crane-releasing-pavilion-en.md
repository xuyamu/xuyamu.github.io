**题放鹤亭**
**On the Crane-Releasing Pavilion**

孤山先灵虽已逝， 
Though the ancient spirit of Solitary Hill has long since passed away,

梅鹤清魂应犹在。 
The pure souls of plums and cranes must surely here stay.

看尽世事沉与浮， 
Having witnessed the world's endless tides of rise and fall,

愿得归隐西子湖。 
I long to find seclusion by the West Lake, away from it all.
