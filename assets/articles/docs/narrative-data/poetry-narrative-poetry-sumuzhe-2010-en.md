**蘇幕遮·夏夜懷故人**
**Su Mu Zhe · Remembering an Old Friend on a Summer Night**

逢故人，未曾料。追憶往事，如煙雨散消。 
Meeting an old friend, a chance unforeseen;
Reminiscing on the past, as it fades like mist and rain from the scene.

韶華不堪悟道早。仰觀寰宇，方識人微渺。 
Youth is too fleeting for early wisdom to take root;
Gazing at the vast cosmos, one finally perceives how small is the human foot.

身未衰，心已老。年少純真，隨流年去了。 
The frame is not yet withered, yet the heart has grown old;
Youthful innocence has drifted away, as the years have unrolled.

夜半無人獨悲愀。盡是淒涼，不眠到天曉。 
Alone in the dead of night, I succumb to a sorrow deep;
Naught but desolation remains, keeping watch until the world wakes from sleep.
