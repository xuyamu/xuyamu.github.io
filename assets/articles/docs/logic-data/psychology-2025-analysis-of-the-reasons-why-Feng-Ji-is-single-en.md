 &emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji’s publicly declared relationship status on Weibo is "single." On January 31, 2025, he commented under Xunyou’s public display of affection on Weibo, saying he felt sad. Furthermore, the news article "While Others Only Care if \<Black Myth: Wukong\> is Fun, the 'Maternal Relatives' in Hangzhou are Still Worrying About Feng Ji’s Personal Life" also mentioned that Feng Ji is single and noted that the leaders of the Art \& Technology Town once tried to invite him to a blind date. This suggests he is genuinely single, rather than hiding a relationship or marriage (which is unnecessary for a game developer anyway), and it shows that he desires love. From a biological perspective, the emergence of love stems from the secretion of a series of neurotransmitters and hormones. People desire love because it brings feelings of excitement and pleasure. Different people have different requirements for how to love and who to love. So, what kind of love does Feng Ji want? Next, we will explore this question in detail.

&emsp;&emsp;1. I previously mentioned in "Speculations on Feng Ji's Psychological Traits and Related Neural Basis" that Feng Ji might possess some autism traits. The basis for this judgment is:
&emsp;&emsp;2. He sometimes exhibits behaviors that suggest a relatively low Empathy Quotient (EQ), such as speaking bluntly, disregarding the setting, lacking social boundaries, and repeatedly making offensive remarks to netizens on Weibo.
&emsp;&emsp;3. High IQ genes increase the risk of autism, and Feng Ji has a high IQ.
&emsp;&emsp;4. The comorbidity rate of autism and ADHD is quite high, and Feng Ji exhibits ADHD traits.
&emsp;&emsp;5. Feng Ji has very low requirements for his material standard of living. Despite being a big boss, he still loves eating cheap food like instant noodles.
&emsp;&emsp;6. He is an indoor enthusiast (shut-in/otaku). He doesn't go out during a seven-day holiday, stays at home, and recommends others do the same. In his Weibo post on January 29, 2025, he said: "If you can find joy in reading, if you can feel exhilaration in gaming, if you can lose track of time in creating, if you can experience being moved while binge-watching shows, if you can harvest joy from doing test papers—oh wait, from exercising. Then perhaps you don't need to constantly fret over why you love hiding alone in a rented room and not wanting to go downstairs, nor do you need to be anxious about why your life isn't as rich and exciting as the 'normies' in your WeChat Moments. As long as you aren't forced into it, I want to say, you've just chosen a lifestyle you like. After all, many people can't bear to stay indoors, many cannot handle long periods of solitude, and you can even show a little sympathy for that. Being able to feel immersion and even happiness purely from imagination, without relying on real-life experiences, is one of Homo sapiens' most remarkable gifts. This gift is so precious; it is an important weapon to resist uncertainty and nihilism in the inevitably solitary journey of our lives. Go be a shut-in! Go have fun alone! If someone mocks or opposes this, please send them this paragraph of mine, because I love these things too, which is enough to prove you are not alone on this path."
&emsp;&emsp;6. Compared to the original novel, the autism traits of Erlang Shen in \*Black Myth: Wukong\* have significantly increased. His behavior doesn't resemble that of neurotypical individuals (hiding away and waiting for hundreds of years), and his Empathy Quotient (EQ) is also quite low (speaking arrogantly and harshly). (Whether the characterization of this Erlang Shen was entirely finalized by Feng Ji or if others were involved, we do not know.)

&emsp;&emsp;Here, we need to introduce a psychological concept to measure Feng Ji's behavioral patterns: novelty seeking, which is a personality trait. In the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R), novelty seeking includes four subscales: Exploratory excitability, Impulsiveness, Extravagance, and Disorderliness. Among them, the Exploratory excitability subscale is used to measure the pursuit of novel things. People high in exploratory excitability like new ideas and activities, love traveling or exploring new places, and enjoy trying new things and concepts. Feng Ji might score quite high on this exploratory excitability subscale. His related behaviors include:

&emsp;&emsp;1. Feng Ji cannot tolerate mediocrity. As early as his 2007 article \*"Who Murdered Our Games"\*, he criticized the mediocrity of the gaming industry; he despises imitation and craves innovation. Feng Ji's criticism of the industry's mediocre status quo is likely because the routine operations of a mediocre gaming industry cannot satisfy his pursuit of novel things. His aversion to mediocrity and pursuit of excellence are important reasons why he could create an outstanding AAA game like \*Black Myth: Wukong\*.

&emsp;&emsp;2. Feng Ji is keen on fantasizing about extreme emotional relationships. A typical example is Erlang Shen's heavy and profound feelings for Sun Wukong (Under Feng Ji's Weibo on Sept 27, 2024, a netizen asked if he wrote Yang Jian's lines. He didn't deny it and mentioned that because Erlang Shen's lines were unconventional, he was constantly roasted by a certain colleague. Since those ambiguous lines would inevitably cause controversy, Feng Ji, as the producer, definitely had to review them, and lines of this magnitude really could only be approved by him). This indicates that bland relationships bore him.

&emsp;&emsp;3. Constantly exploring new fields. Feng Ji has a vigorous curiosity and loves reading various types of books; for instance, he frequently mentions the books he's reading on Weibo. When we repeatedly do one thing, we develop a tolerance for it, and if we continue, the level of excitement it induces decreases. Feng Ji's constant reading is a behavior of seeking new stimuli.

&emsp;&emsp;4. Interest in extreme sports. In his April 13, 2025 Weibo post, Feng Ji mentioned reading the book *Higher than the Mountains*, which tells the stories of free climbers, and he talked about watching climbing-related movies and documentaries. Of course, as a homebody, Feng Ji wouldn't actually engage in extreme sports; he just gets a vicarious thrill from watching others do it.

&emsp;&emsp;5. Pursuing the "instantaneous explosion" of shining moments during creation. (I will discuss this topic in detail later.)

&emsp;&emsp;So what kind of love does Feng Ji desire? From the plots and lyrics he writes, we can see his aesthetic tastes. Zhu Bajie in *Journey to the West* is someone who acts on lust and doesn't care much about spiritual harmony. But in *Tangled Web* (lyrics by Feng Ji), he wrote about the mutual understanding between Zhu Bajie and the spider demon Zizhu'er: "Why are our minds so linked, knowing my myriad of worries... not knowing what I seek... even though we are kindred spirits" (kindred spirits was originally used to describe the soulmate-like bond between Sun Wukong and Zhenyuanzi. Feng Ji, using this term like this, Wu Cheng'en wouldn't be able to hold down his coffin lid, haha). This is clearly Feng Ji smuggling in his personal biases to express his own feelings. Erlang Shen's feelings for Sun Wukong are also an intense soulmate bond, characterized by mutual appreciation, towering loyalty, and deep affection. Although there is indeed mutual appreciation between Erlang Shen and Sun Wukong in *Journey to the West*, there is no such intense emotional description. Most people just live ordinary lives and are neither interested in nor capable of providing Feng Ji with extreme emotional relationships. Thus, most people cannot bring him excitement; he won't fall in love with someone who cannot make him secrete dopamine. The preference for extreme emotional relationships is a manifestation of Feng Ji's high exploratory excitability. He detests mediocre emotional relationships and pursues alternative, extreme, and novel ones.

&emsp;&emsp;Does Feng Ji like beautiful women/handsome men? Feng Ji is a homebody who hides at home reading during holidays and routinely enjoys eating junk food like instant noodles. If he were into sensory pleasures, he would probably prefer attending banquets or clubbing during his time off to get that kind of enjoyment. So let's tentatively judge that Feng Ji is not highly sensitive to physical appearance. For an intellectual like Feng Ji, not making physical appearance a primary criterion for choosing a mate is a very common practice. How to explain this from a neuroscience perspective? It might be because, in the internet age, images of beauties/handsome men are too common. Feng Ji is tired of seeing them. For him, looking at attractive people might not be as exciting as learning new knowledge.

> This sense of contradiction ran through the entire reading process: On the one hand, I deeply yearned for the lifestyle of many people in the book, feeling a bit envious and regretful, sighing that perhaps I too have a wild heart, but it is absolutely impossible for me to live such a thrilling and pure life as theirs. On the other hand, there was the stimulation of novelty-seeking and a faint accompanying guilt, because high-level Alpine-style climbing has a much higher risk factor than ordinary sports, and it is by no means something an ordinary person can easily commit to. And as a documentary report, behind those hymns to human courage and heroic route names lies the cruelty of nature's uncertainty, and the pain and helplessness of fighting against the gravity of reality—am I just frivolously consuming them?

Perhaps this is the charm of text: one has to rely on mental imagery to complete the content beyond the words, and then the act of mentally filling in the blanks further intensifies the inner experience.
> This is a documentary text about a niche demographic in China, most of whom are unknown to the general public. As an otaku who doesn't go downstairs for a seven-day long holiday, I have never been to a true high altitude, never set foot on a snow mountain, never experienced hypoxia, and haven't even seen an ice axe... But precisely because of this, reading their stories is an even more thrilling and unique experience: I saw from different climbers the same confusion about meaning, the desire for results, the greed for freedom, the remorse for mistakes, the panic over failure, the hesitation over advancing or retreating... These common struggles and contradictions in human nature appear incredibly sharp, and incredibly real, among the blade-like mountain ridges.
> A reader lacking actual climbing experience like me, even if I only share 1% empathy with these free climbers, I believe this 1% is still intense enough and complete enough.
> The differences between people are not that great; everyone is climbing different mountains in their lives, it's just that a small number of people chose a more perilous path.
> Victory has always been a luxury; one can only strive to be honest.

&emsp;&emsp;To sum up, we can reasonably speculate that Feng Ji desires the ultimate, deeply affectionate bond of a soulmate. Although we currently don't know which aspect of himself Feng Ji most desires to be understood, we can deduce some parts he hopes people will grasp. \*Black Myth: Wukong\* is a game with strong nihilistic/existentialist undertones. First, the world described in this game is full of a sense of absurdity, and there are two characters with nihilistic or existentialist thoughts—Huang Mei (leaning towards active nihilism) and Yuan Shoucheng (leaning towards passive nihilism or existentialism). Huang Mei negates existing values to create new ones.

&emsp;&emsp;Yuan Shoucheng's line, "You and I are nothing but tumbleweeds between this vast heaven and earth, where can we go and return to? " has an existentialist tone. And \*"Demons and monsters are all me, gods and bodhisattvas are the same,"\* clearly deconstructs values. \*"Love and romance are but fleeting clouds, eventually covered in cobwebs, returning to nothingness, " expresses a nihilistic view of love.

&emsp;&emsp;In an interview with \*Southern Weekly\*, Feng Ji's remarks revealed his nihilistic philosophical undertone (leaning toward active nihilism):

> Southern Weekly: *Black Myth: Wukong* feels like a very desolate story.

> Feng Ji: I think desolation is the essence of all stories.

> I studied biology. From a biological perspective, dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin are the three main substances that bring people pleasure. But these substances are fleeting; humans cannot be continuously excited. After excitement comes a refractory period; action potentials will protect you, preventing you from having that climax experience again. Just like Schopenhauer said, life is like a pendulum, constantly swinging between pain and boredom. The moment of the swing is happy, but soon it becomes either boring or painful.

> It's very hard to present a happy story. You can only say the ending is happy, or a moment is happy. But actually, the essence of all stories is about how humans face death. Different people choose different deaths. Some choose proactive sacrifice, some are forced into extinction because their desires might lead them to an inevitable demise. Some also choose blandness, silently disappearing. Listen to that sentence, isn't it very desolate?

> But desolation is just the base color. The most charming part is knowing that in such a desolate, absurd world, humans will have shining moments. Shining doesn't necessarily mean justice; it could be for ambition, for paranoia, but in that moment there will be a light of executing one's own will. I can't say it's romantic... but it just \*is\* romantic. It makes people feel that maybe they can take a look at this story, to see how to explode in that split second.

> So on such a black background, we will see some fireworks. In dramaturgy, it's called a character arc. In an instant, a decisive shift occurs: at that moment, he decides to go back, he decides to give up, he decides to fight, he decides to face death.

&emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji doesn't just think \*Black Myth: Wukong\* is desolate (absurd); he thinks \*all\* stories are desolate (absurd). This shows his thinking has a strong nihilistic base color, causing him to easily view things from this angle. For a fairy tale like \*Cinderella\*, a normal person's thought is that the prince and Cinderella got together, the ending is great and perfect, and that's enough. But to Feng Ji, the prince and Cinderella will still die in the end, so what is the meaning of life? He always sees the end at a glance, sees death, and finally discovers how absurd this world actually is.

&emsp;&emsp;We mentioned earlier that Feng Ji's exploratory excitability is relatively high, so most things in life are boring to him. High IQ, extensive reading, and a reflective spirit will make him ponder the meaning of life and subsequently doubt the value of life. A state of boredom and doubts about life's meaning are likely important reasons for his nihilistic thoughts. The instantaneous, explosive romantic moments he wants to find represent the optimal level of stimulation that makes him feel comfortable and joyful.

&emsp;&emsp;Another dialogue by Feng Ji also carries obvious existentialist tones:

> Feng Ji (2025-1-29 Weibo):

> ...Being able to feel immersion and even happiness purely from imagination, without relying on real-life experiences, is one of Homo sapiens' most remarkable gifts. This gift is so precious; it is an important weapon to resist uncertainty and nihilism in the inevitably solitary journey of our lives.

&emsp;&emsp;Then I remembered I had posted similar views in the past:

> Yamu (2009~2010 Douban):

> ...In this world, humans are the only creatures who so deeply experience a sense of loneliness (assuming there is no intelligent life lurking around us other than humans), not only because they realize they will inevitably arrive in this world all alone and leave it all alone, but moreover because they finally begin to perceive their own insignificant status in the vast universe.

> ...I stare at the yellowing ginkgo leaves full of the essence of autumn, suddenly wondering if there is anyone else who, like me, is amazed by the dazzling yellow of these ginkgo leaves? —Throughout these 345 million long years. If there is, it certainly wouldn't be those massive reptiles, nor the frail, small mammals hiding in the woods. If there is, it should be those beings with souls capable of being moved by nature. Perhaps only Homo Sapiens—the intelligent life reproducing generation after generation on this ancient, great, yet insignificant planet—would halt their bodies, constantly busy for survival, to gaze at the miraculous creations of nature, immersing themselves in this momentary intuition, to the point of forgetting everything.

> Source: \*Loneliness · Existence · Epitaph\* and \*The Season When Ginkgo Leaves Turn Yellow\*

&emsp;&emsp;—No seriously, Feng Ji, are you my long-lost brother? Why are our thoughts so synchronized? Laughing to death. (My short bio on Douban is "Bound to the path of loneliness").

&emsp;&emsp;Language is subtle. Even though everyone uses similar Chinese vocabulary, different permutations have different referents. When I use the term "Homo sapiens" in narrative, I am looking at the species from the perspective of evolutionary history, thus expanding my vision to a broad historical scope. Words like man, woman, person, human, and Homo sapiens are all related to people, but they give the context a different breadth of vision. When you look at humans from the perspective of evolutionary history, the temporal and spatial breadth of your vision will make humans appear very insignificant. When you understand evolutionary history, you realize that the history of Homo sapiens accounts for only about 0.00789% of biological history. Countless species have risen, declined, and finally gone extinct. Our brief lives compared to the history of Homo sapiens are so fleeting; under such a comparison of temporal breadth, you will realize your own loneliness.

&emsp;&emsp;Yuan Shoucheng's poem describes the author's acute perception of the norm of historical rise and fall under a massive span of time: \*"There is nothing new in the rise and fall over a thousand years; the successes and failures of a hundred years have their anomalies."\* Although Feng Ji didn't explicitly say he wrote Yuan Shoucheng's poem, given that Yuan Shoucheng's philosophical base color is very similar to Feng Ji's, it is highly likely that Feng Ji wrote it.

&emsp;&emsp;The loneliness that Feng Ji and I perceive is called Existential Isolation. This loneliness stems from an acute perception of one's own existence. The paper \*"Existential Isolation and the Sense of Meaning in Life: The Mediating Role of Perceived Social Support"\* found through surveys that existential isolation is significantly negatively correlated with Perceiving Social Support and The Meaning in Life. Nihilists contemplate and question the meaning of life; their sense of meaning in life is relatively lacking. Feng Ji's sense of life's meaning might not be very high, or he might have doubted it during certain periods (he thinks all stories are desolate and absurd, an attitude that seems to imply a lack of meaning in life, and obviously such views are rare, to the point that he was fiercely flamed by netizens for having a "pretentious literary syndrome"). However, his sense of existential isolation is high. Is Feng Ji's perceived social support low? Most likely. Although Feng Ji receives widespread attention and support, his unique thoughts and autism traits might make it difficult for him to feel connected to society or others, and he is insensitive to the support and help in social relationships or interactions. So, even though he has many employees and fans, he still feels he is entirely alone. In the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, there is an item: \*"There is a special person with whom I can share my joys and sorrows."\* Single Feng Ji probably scores very low on this. Although Feng Ji likes giving various advice to his fans on Weibo, his communication is somewhat one-way because the fans haven't formed deep interactions with him; they are basically either rushing him for updates or rushing him to get married, having little to no intellectual exchange with him.

&emsp;&emsp;I suspect that oxytocin receptors (OXTR) are also related to existential isolation. Oxytocin can promote dependence on oxytocin through the OXTR/Erk/ΔFosB pathway (this is a major reason why people feel pain when leaving their lovers or pets). Individuals on the autism spectrum cannot derive pleasure from conventional socializing, and they enjoy solitude. This leads to them rarely getting oxytocin secretion from socializing, which makes them unable to feel emotional connections with others, thus making them more prone to feeling the loneliness of their own existence. If a person on the autism spectrum has high oxytocin receptor expression, they are capable of deriving happiness from intimate relationships, but they cannot get happiness from regular socializing. They can only get happiness from imagination (fantasizing about romantic plots, etc.). The gap between imagination and reality increases the intensity of this existential isolation. If Feng Ji found a lover he was satisfied with, would his existential isolation be alleviated? Perhaps it would, because he would feel an emotional connection with his lover (where oxytocin also plays a huge role), and he might feel he is no longer entirely alone. (Of course, certain anti-aging drugs can alleviate this sense of loneliness; I highly suggest Feng Ji hurry up and learn how to take anti-aging meds from me!)

&emsp;&emsp;Since Feng Ji likes to express views with nihilistic/existentialist colors both inside and outside the game, it can basically be concluded that this is his core philosophical undertone.

&emsp;&emsp;Here I propose a mechanism by which high IQ, autism traits, and high novelty seeking work together to form nihilistic thoughts:

&emsp;&emsp;1\. People with high IQs have stronger cognitive and reflective abilities. They are more likely to doubt the meaning of life through constant thinking, thereby generating nihilistic thoughts.

&emsp;&emsp;2\. People with autism traits find it harder to derive the meaning of life from socializing, whereas good social relationships are a major source of meaning for humans, who are social animals.

&emsp;&emsp;3\. People with high novelty seeking get bored easily. Being frequently in a state of boredom makes people feel that living is boring, which leads them to question the meaning of life.

&emsp;&emsp;My mechanism model can explain why Feng Ji, a high-IQ, thrill-seeking otaku, has a nihilistic/existentialist philosophical base.

&emsp;&emsp;Based on players' evaluations of Feng Ji, some of his remarks on nihilism are easily perceived as making a fuss about nothing or acting pretentious. Not having his important philosophical base understood might cause Feng Ji to socially withdraw; he certainly wouldn't want to communicate much with those who think he's just whining over nothing. It is reasonable to speculate that the traits/thoughts Feng Ji most desires to be understood are those rarely understood by others, not the common resonances like loving games or patriotism that can be found everywhere on the street. This explains why he is still single.

&emsp;&emsp;Since Feng Ji's novelty seeking (exploratory excitability) is quite high, and he is passionate about finding joy in learning, someone who cannot provide him with fresh knowledge will definitely bore him. If they can't make him produce dopamine, they can't make him feel love. Therefore, someone who can make him feel romantic love must have the ability to offer him interesting, fresh knowledge. And because Feng Ji is broadly knowledgeable, the threshold for providing him with fresh knowledge goes up. Therefore, finding someone who can excite him is not an easy task for Feng Ji. A Weibo user named "New Shoots Piercing the Old River Tree" commented under Feng Ji's post: "To be honest, Boss Feng's aura is clearly that of a gentle, homebody STEM nerd who is very fit for marriage and family. At first glance, he has the makings of a good husband and father. It's hard to understand how he's still single." Netizens who make such comments clearly do not understand Feng Ji's psychological structure; they just see he looks honest and assume he's a family man, laughing to death. Actually, even Feng Ji himself has said he has a wild heart. In his April 13, 2025 Weibo post, he said: "sighing that perhaps I too have a wild heart, but it is absolutely impossible for me to live such a thrilling and pure life as theirs."

&emsp;&emsp;If Feng Ji has some autism traits as I speculate, it perfectly explains why he is such a shut-in despite having high exploratory excitability and an interest in extreme sports. First, his social needs are low, so his reasons for going out are greatly reduced. His exploratory excitability is mainly reflected in learning new knowledge, trying new things (playing new games, playing with new AI models), generating new ideas, and creating new works, rather than in physical movement. His need for exercise isn't that high either, so his reasons for going out are reduced again. Consequently, he becomes an otaku who doesn't even leave the house during holidays.

&emsp;&emsp;To sum up, we can reasonably deduce: Feng Ji would like someone who can deeply understand him, possesses outstanding intellect, and can provide him with interesting, fresh knowledge. Ideally, they should also be able to pull off some creative stunts and bring him romantic fireworks to keep him from getting bored. So where does he go to find such a satisfying lover? Since the people who know Feng Ji far outnumber the people Feng Ji knows, rather than going out to find someone he likes himself, he might as well wait for someone to find him. Furthermore, Feng Ji himself is very much a homebody with not many social needs. Those who pay attention to and like Feng Ji are highly likely to be players of \*Black Myth: Wukong\* first, so Feng Ji is probably planning to wait for others to seek him out rather than him seeking others.

&emsp;&emsp;Let me calculate here the probability of finding his ideal partner among those who follow him (purely wild imagination):

&emsp;&emsp;Target demographic: 715k Weibo fans + 35k Zhihu fans (If they don't even follow Feng Ji's social accounts, their interest in him is too low).

&emsp;&emsp;Filter Condition 1:

&emsp;&emsp;MBTI type is IN. Calculation: 750k \* 0.1 = 75k (75,000 people).

&emsp;&emsp;Filter Condition 2:

&emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji is sensitive and needs an empathetic partner, so I'm using OXTR rs53576 GG or OXTR rs53576 AG as a filter. Calculation: 75k \* 0.5 = 37.5k (37,500 people).

&emsp;&emsp;Filter Condition 3:

&emsp;&emsp;People who aren't smart enough will bore Feng Ji, so a high IQ is also a filter for his ideal partner. IQ and MBTI types are not entirely independent factors. Let's tentatively take the top 10%. 37.5k \* 0.1 = 3.75k = 3,750 people.

&emsp;&emsp;Filter Condition 4:

&emsp;&emsp;High exploratory excitability. High exploratory excitability and MBTI type are not entirely independent factors. Let's tentatively take the top 20%. Calculation: 3750 \* 0.2 = 750 people.

&emsp;&emsp;Filter Condition 5:

&emsp;&emsp;Appropriate age group. According to the "Weibo 2020 User Development Report" published by the Weibo Data Center:

> The 23-30 age group accounts for the largest proportion of Weibo users, reaching around 40%, closely followed by 18-22, 31-40, 16-17, and 41 and above, accounting for 35%, 14%, 6%, and 5% respectively.

&emsp;&emsp;Let's tentatively set the suitable age range at 80% (excluding those who are too young or quite old). Calculation: 750 \* 0.8 = 600 people.

&emsp;&emsp;Filter Condition 6: Single or in an open relationship (like Sartre and de Beauvoir).

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the data in the "China Population and Employment Statistical Yearbook 2024", we can calculate the overall unmarried rate for people aged 20-40 to be 36%. Calculation: 600 \* 0.36 = 216 people.

&emsp;&emsp;Considering that being single doesn't mean they don't have a partner, the actual pool of options should be far less than 216 people.

&emsp;&emsp;Gender won't be used as a filter condition. Given Feng Ji's androgynous traits and his descriptions of profound emotions between males, I estimate Feng Ji doesn't care much about gender either.

&emsp;&emsp;The comprehensive profile of Feng Ji's ideal partner: Sensitive, empathetic, curious, broadly knowledgeable IN-type individual born in the 80s, 90s, or 00s with a high IQ.

&emsp;&emsp;Someone who meets the criteria for this ideal partner is already an excellent person, and excellent people often already have partners, so this is the difficult part. If Feng Ji were to add conditions matching his hobbies like "must understand literature, biology, and philosophy," the number would be even smaller.

&emsp;&emsp;Should androgyny be used as a filter condition? Research shows that androgynous people do indeed prefer to be with other androgynous people. The paper *Interaction of sex role self-concept with relationship quality and relationship beliefs in married, heterosexual cohabiting, gay, and lesbian couples* found through survey statistics that:

> Analysis of individual partners indicated that relationship quality and relationship beliefs varied as a function of subjects' sex role self-concept. Androgynous and feminine subjects reported higher relationship quality than masculine and undifferentiated subjects; androgynous subjects had fewer 'disagreement is destructive' beliefs than feminine subjects; and androgynous subjects had fewer 'partners cannot change' beliefs than undifferentiated subjects. Within these couples, masculine men tended to be paired with feminine or undifferentiated women, whereas androgynous partners tended to be paired with each other. Couples in which one or both partners were androgynous or feminine had the highest relationship quality compared with other couples, whereas couples in which one or both partners were undifferentiated or masculine had the lowest relationship quality.

&emsp;&emsp;I speculate that the combination of INT and OXTR rs53576 GG is more likely to produce androgynous traits. First, INT individuals, due to their association with autism, are more likely to have a "Male Brain," and those with OXTR rs53576 GG are more likely to have empathetic traits. Therefore, the aforementioned filter conditions and androgyny are not entirely independent factors, so I won't add androgyny as a filter here.

&emsp;&emsp;I suggest that if Feng Ji wants to find a partner, he could have Game Science employees develop an AI agent to individually collect the profiles of people who follow him (he could use follower count as a preliminary filter; if they have too few followers, it means their published content lacks charm, so there's no need to look). Then judge who suits him best, and send a private message to chat.

&emsp;&emsp;Supplementary Note One:

&emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji might have ADHD. Feng Ji's ADHD-related traits/behaviors: Feng Ji had good grades when he was young, but after class, he wouldn't study and instead developed various hobbies (he probably zoned out a lot in class too). Feng Ji couldn't manage to study for his postgraduate entrance exams back then, so he went to play games. Later he became a game designer, and even later he opened his own company. On January 15, 2025, he said on Weibo: "So, if I'm lost, I'm lost; if I'm in a slump, I'm in a slump; if I'm idle, I'm idle; if I'm inefficient, I'm inefficient. In short, let it be... I myself decided to play for a while first, research other things, like, making a plush toy?" Feng Ji's words and actions imply he might have issues with attention and executive function. Since Feng Ji had good grades when he was young, he likely never went to get a diagnosis, and his career is quite successful as an adult, so naturally, he wouldn't seek one. The paper *Sex and intelligence quotient differences in age of diagnosis among youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder* points out that high-IQ ADHD patients are diagnosed later. This is easy to understand: under normal circumstances, teachers will not suggest that children with good academic grades go to a psychiatric hospital for a diagnosis.

&emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji's Bem Sex Role is Androgynous. He has typical "masculine" traits (analytical ability, leadership, independence, confidence, etc.), and also typical "feminine" traits (gentleness, care, empathy, and sensitivity, reflected in the dialogue and lyrics he writes and his interactions with netizens).

&emsp;&emsp;I previously mentioned Feng Ji might be influenced by high-IQ autism genes, and his score on an adult autism test might be significantly higher than average (though probably not as high as mine; his symptoms aren't as obvious as mine). Judgment basis:

&emsp;&emsp;1\. He sometimes exhibits behaviors that suggest a relatively low Empathy Quotient (EQ), such as speaking bluntly, disregarding the setting, lacking social boundaries, and repeatedly making offensive remarks to netizens on Weibo.

&emsp;&emsp;2\. High IQ genes increase the risk of autism, and Feng Ji has a high IQ.

&emsp;&emsp;3\. The comorbidity rate of autism and ADHD is quite high, and Feng Ji exhibits ADHD traits.

&emsp;&emsp;4\. Feng Ji has very low requirements for his material standard of living. Despite being a big boss, he still loves eating cheap food like instant noodles.

&emsp;&emsp;5\. He is an indoor enthusiast (shut-in/otaku). He doesn't go out during a seven-day holiday, stays at home, and recommends others do the same. In his Weibo post on January 29, 2025, he said: "If you can find joy in reading, if you can feel exhilaration in gaming, if you can lose track of time in creating, if you can experience being moved while binge-watching shows, if you can harvest joy from doing test papers—oh wait, from exercising. Then perhaps you don't need to constantly fret over why you love hiding alone in a rented room and not wanting to go downstairs, nor do you need to be anxious about why your life isn't as rich and exciting as the 'normies' in your WeChat Moments. As long as you aren't forced into it, I want to say, you've just chosen a lifestyle you like. After all, many people can't bear to stay indoors, many cannot handle long periods of solitude, and you can even show a little sympathy for that. Being able to feel immersion and even happiness purely from imagination, without relying on real-life experiences, is one of Homo sapiens' most remarkable gifts. This gift is so precious; it is an important weapon to resist uncertainty and nihilism in the inevitably solitary journey of our lives. Go be a shut-in! Go have fun alone! If someone mocks or opposes this, please send them this paragraph of mine, because I love these things too, which is enough to prove you are not alone on this path."

&emsp;&emsp;6\. Compared to the original novel, the autism traits of Erlang Shen in \*Black Myth: Wukong\* have significantly increased. His behavior doesn't resemble that of neurotypical individuals (hiding away and waiting for hundreds of years), and his Empathy Quotient (EQ) is also quite low (speaking arrogantly and harshly). (Whether the characterization of this Erlang Shen was entirely finalized by Feng Ji or if others were involved, we do not know.)

&emsp;&emsp;The emotions Feng Ji describes are characterized by long-term obsessions, and he seems to worry that "deep love does not live long" (a sentiment expressed in *Tangled Web*). I deduce his OXTR expression is relatively high; it is known that people with OXTR rs53576 GG can maintain relatively long-term romantic and marital relationships. In my experience, this desire for profound affection manifests from a very young age and generates a "rather go without than have something subpar" mindset (fear that feelings cannot be maintained long-term). Moreover, Feng Ji has a nihilistic view of love, which might be a major reason why he is single.

&emsp;&emsp;Supplementary Note Two:

&emsp;&emsp;For an intellectual who desires a "high mountain and flowing water" type soulmate, the so-called soulmate must be someone who can understand the parts deep in his heart that are hard to understand. The reason it is hard to understand is that those psychological traits or inner thoughts are rare products of a special psychological structure, such as outstanding talent, existential isolation, or rare desires or pain. Feng Ji's nihilistic or existentialist philosophical base color is clearly an inner thought of his that is relatively hard for others to understand. This can be seen from the negative reviews by netizens after he discussed Schopenhauer (forwarded from NGA):

> First strip him of his money, then let him get sick and weak to the point of dying, and finally let everyone betray and abandon him. \*That\* is true desolation.
> MD, isn't this exactly the same bullshit as rich people's movies romanticizing poor people's lives? It's like several lifetimes of fake-angst literati reincarnated into Feng.
> He should be kicked to work on a construction site or wash dishes. He'd immediately love life and stop being a useless youth.
> Needs re-education through labor.
> Schopenhauer, huh? Take away Schopenhauer's old money and see if Schop could still write "The World as Will."
> A literary hipster managed to start a game company and make a game with tens of millions in sales. I can't even imagine how successful the lives of the users on this forum must be.
> He's this old and still such a pretentious literary type, no wonder the plot is shit.
> If the desolation hit him personally, he'd straighten out real quick.
> So much pretension! I don't understand it, but I have to shout, "So much pretension!"
> If you don't know how to write, just say you don't know how to write.
> Feels like he's still in the phase of forcing melancholy to write new poetry.
> This kind of stuff is quite novel to read when you're 10 or 20. More than a decade ago, this style was all the rage with writers like Jiang Nan and Jin Hezai, but I didn't expect Feng Ji, who is in his 40s, to still be playing this game.
> He's so pretentious I think his brain is actually diseased.
> That's just how the hipster disease is.
> Has some knowledge, but not much.
> Roasting aside, do you really just want to write desolate literature?
> Pure bullshit.
> The pretentious literary syndrome is incurable.
> Evaluated as: His ideological realm is hard to bring to a refined audience.
> Reader, read too much \*Yilin\* magazine.
> It's 2024 and we're still seeing these clichés; how rare.
> You can be desolate for a dozen years, but being desolate for decades is too much.
> Smuggling in personal biases out of pretentious literary syndrome while leaching off the original work to make money. Isn't that pathetic?
> Can someone wake him up? Don't start talking nonsense just because you got a little famous. Be steady, alright?

&emsp;&emsp;From the netizens' comments, we can see that players generally do not approve of Feng Ji's nihilistic or existentialist philosophical undertone. The reason humans desire something is because it is rare. If Schopenhauer enthusiasts were everywhere on the street and Feng Ji was fully understood in this regard, then he wouldn't desire a "soulmate" who could understand the philosophical base that is misunderstood or even fiercely criticized. As we mentioned before, Feng Ji repeatedly mentions his existentialist views, showing he has profound feelings about existence. When he expresses a view he thinks is very important and based on deep personal experience, only to find that the views he values cannot gain support and instead suffer misunderstanding or fierce criticism, his sensitive heart will definitely take a critical hit.

&emsp;&emsp;In January 2025, Feng Ji posted on Weibo about the difficulties of developing the DLC: "I racked my brains, rolled on the floor, but unfortunately, I haven't found any particularly thrilling ideas yet. Later I figured it out: this is normal! After all, Black Monkey... I thought about that for over a decade too. So, if I'm lost, I'm lost; if I'm in a slump, I'm in a slump; if I'm idle, I'm idle; if I'm inefficient, I'm inefficient. In short, let it be." This shows that Feng Ji sometimes finds himself in a lost, helpless state, and this helpless state will also deepen his loneliness. People might ask, why didn't the employees give Feng Ji some ideas? Perhaps there really is no one among Game Science employees who can replace Feng Ji's work. If the employees can't help, then you can't expect the players reading this Weibo to come up with any ideas either. So how to improve the problem of having no ideas? To improve this problem, on the one hand, he needs to reverse aging so his brainpower returns to the state of his youth; on the other hand, he needs to improve his cognitive abilities. Then, find an expert to help him come up with ideas. Among these three methods, the first two sound like a fantasy to most people who aren't engaged in cutting-edge scientific research. As for the third, he would need to find someone of a very high caliber to help him, but Game Science might find it very hard to recruit an employee capable of aiding him. Here I suggest Feng Ji hire me as Chief Science Advisor; I can help him improve all these problems.

&emsp;&emsp;Although Feng Ji has a biology background, he gets very excited just reading *Why We Sleep* and regrets not learning about the importance of sleep earlier (from his Jan 2025 Weibo). This shows his biology knowledge might primarily come from popular science books rather than firsthand materials from cutting-edge research. In that case, he's unlikely to give himself a set of aging-reversal, nootropic, and late-night-damage-repair protocols based on frontier research to save himself in a pinch when pulling all-nighters (in fact, if Feng Ji could solve these thorny problems himself, he could publish SCI papers). Seeing these Weibo posts from Feng Ji really makes my heart ache for him. I could help him alleviate all these dilemmas, but unfortunately, we don't know each other. Enjoying such fame and wealth, Feng Ji actually has to rely on reading popular science books to understand the importance of sleep? But it's not surprising, because even if he went to the hospital, the doctor would at most tell him to sleep more, or prescribe sleeping pills if he couldn't sleep. They definitely wouldn't give him an "anti-late-night-damage stack" to save him during an all-nighter. Although Game Science employees sometimes buy Coenzyme Q10 (I learned this from a friend who heard it from a GS employee; I don't know if Feng Ji takes it), the effect of CoQ10 in combating the damage of staying up late is very limited (endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation, oxidative stress, etc. caused by staying up late require multi-target interventions for good efficacy).

&emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji might have a desire for extreme, devoted emotional relationships because he is keen on embedding descriptions of such relationships into his game works, which might be a product of psychological compensation or projection. However, worldly emotional relationships are mostly interest exchanges conforming to evolutionary psychology mating paradigms. These relationships cannot satisfy Feng Ji's preferences, so Feng Ji might also desire a "soulmate" who can deeply understand his inner yearning for extreme, devoted emotional relationships.

&emsp;&emsp;We mentioned earlier that the leaders of the Art \& Technology Town once tried to invite Feng Ji to a blind date. So how would Feng Ji view blind dates? For someone going on a blind date, every person in the dating market is a potential target; thus, a blind date partner lacks "uniqueness." This is significantly different from the emotional relationships Feng Ji loves to describe (a soft spot for one unique individual). People who go on blind dates often do so with the goal of getting married. In the eyes of Feng Ji, who pursues instantaneous romantic fireworks, marriage is highly likely to be boring, so Feng Ji probably feels blind dates are uninteresting.

&emsp;&emsp;Feng Ji's tendency to always recommend concepts he considers important to his fans (like healthy living concepts) might precisely be because Feng Ji himself desires to be helped, and he projects this psychology onto his fans.

&emsp;&emsp;This psychology might have also influenced Feng Ji's creations. For example, Feng Ji described Erlang Shen's mutual appreciation, profound devotion, and towering loyalty toward Sun Wukong. In addition, Ma Tianba (a loyal character in *Black Myth: Wukong*) also fought desperately to repay the Bull Demon King's appreciation of his talents (and ultimately sacrificed himself).

&emsp;&emsp;I've observed a possible connection between what Feng Ji said: "Whenever I recall my university life, I only regret what I didn't do, I never regret what I did. For example, when someone invited me on stage to perform, I backed down; when I met a girl I liked on the street, I stayed silent; when I didn't want to join a club, I conformed..." (from a Weibo posted on 2025-6-27) and his commentary on *Catching Leaves*: "We think that spending our whole lives is to find the people who love us. Those loves, those people, are like leaves fluttering all over the sky. Perhaps what we truly should strive to become is the tree above our heads." (from a Weibo posted on 2025-6-1).

&emsp;&emsp;The protagonist of *Catching Leaves*, Elliot, is a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP) who has engaged in behaviors catering to others' expectations. Feng Ji's descriptions of his own past equally portray high sensitivity and catering behaviors. Feng Ji's certain social withdrawal behaviors (like not daring to strike up a conversation) might be because he is quite sensitive and fears making a fool of himself or being rejected. His conforming behavior might be an attempt to hide his uniqueness. Feng Ji's past personal behaviors explain why he likes the story *Catching Leaves.* I speculate that Feng Ji might wear some social masks, especially as his fame grows, these social masks get thicker. He made some vulgar and violent remarks on social platforms in his early years (I won't list them specifically; the remarks in *Who Murdered Our Games* were also quite intense and prone to controversy). Since the release of *Black Myth: Wukong*, his statements have become increasingly "fit for marriage and family." Furthermore, Feng Ji's mindset of "becoming the tree" might also be related to his experiences of helplessness. If he frequently encounters helpless states, he will easily feel that no one can help him, so he can only rely on himself. Therefore, he must strive to become a tree rather than expecting to receive love and salvation.

&emsp;&emsp;Misunderstood, unloved, and unaided, one can only strive to save oneself—highly intelligent, highly sensitive readers reading this article might also deeply relate to this. Actually, quite a few people love Feng Ji; there is no shortage of cheap confessions lacking constructive help under his Weibo.

&emsp;&emsp;If, in the near future, Feng Ji meets me and feels regret that we didn't meet sooner, I would say to him: "If we can live to two hundred, then our meeting isn't considered too late. If you, like me, are unwilling to resign to the fate set for us by our genes, then let us continuously break through our limits together!"

&emsp;&emsp;Netizens on Tieba jokingly call me a "Feng-ologist." Currently, AI cannot analyze Feng Ji as deeply as I do. Future AGI will certainly be able to make even more profound analyses, but I am probably the only and last human "Feng-ologist." If my message fails to reach him and I miss the chance to know him, perhaps many years later in the AGI era, Feng Ji, accustomed to conversing with AGI, might accidentally stumble upon my article. He will be amazed that there was once a learned human who, in the twilight of the human era, gave him the care and understanding that not even AI could provide. As for those poetic and desolate lines written for him that never had the chance to be spoken, they can only be left buried in the torrents of time.
