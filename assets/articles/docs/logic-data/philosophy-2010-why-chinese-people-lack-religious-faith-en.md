&emsp;&emsp;*(This text is a reflection after listening to Deng Xiaomang's lecture)*

Dear Professor Deng:

&emsp;&emsp;I am a sophomore at the China Academy of Art. I enjoy reading and thinking in my daily life, but I suffer from the fact that most people around me are "inauthentic Dasein" who have "fallen into the They" (*das Man*). There is almost no one with whom I can discuss the philosophy of life; thus, I can only befriend books and find solace in dialogues with the sages. Fortunately, we are now in the information age. Through the internet, I have met many like-minded individuals and have been able to watch and listen to lectures by scholars online, thinking and exploring while listening to the vivid and wise words of my seniors.

&emsp;&emsp;Recently, through the internet, I had the honor of listening to your lecture given at the 4th "Luojia Spring" Science and Culture Festival at Wuhan University, titled "Why Do Chinese People Lack Faith?". I was greatly inspired. As I listened and reflected, questions arose in my mind that I wish to explore with you.

&emsp;&emsp;My first question is: What is the reason why Chinese people rarely have faith nowadays (referring here to Christian faith; saying they have absolutely no faith is too absolute and inconsistent with reality)?

&emsp;&emsp;In your lecture, you discussed the understanding of religion in traditional Chinese culture, arguing that traditional Chinese beliefs are closely related to material concepts, leaning towards pragmatism, and lacking the transcendental spiritual concepts found in Western Christianity. Theoretically, the Christian God indeed possesses the conceptual characteristics of transcendence and the "other shore." However, if we examine the actual attitudes of religious believers, we find that the understanding of Christianity varies among different believers—the chapters discussing the concept of God in Western traditional culture in Robert Solomon's *The Big Questions: A Short Introduction to Philosophy* provide evidence for this.

&emsp;&emsp;To elucidate my thought process, I would like to first discuss my understanding of a question: Why do humans endorse religion?

&emsp;&emsp;My conclusions are as follows:

&emsp;&emsp;The reasons humans endorse religion include:

&emsp;&emsp;1. Spiritual Faith: Hoping to seek explanation, hope, comfort, sustenance, and salvation through religion. (In Christian faith, there is a particular emphasis on faith in the world of the "other shore.") This can be subdivided into two types:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(1) Rational Faith: Pursuing truth within faith, seeking an explanation of the world through religion, and proving the rationality of religious belief through intellectual methods. (The faith of Thomas Aquinas belongs to this category).

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(2) Passionate Faith: Believing in religion through passion, gaining spiritual sustenance through faith, and breaking free from a sense of meaninglessness.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Based on the depth of understanding of the faith, this can be further subdivided into two types:

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;① Those who have never conducted detailed reasoning or verification of their faith, but embark on the path of faith and remain steadfast solely out of emotional needs.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;② Those who have conducted detailed reasoning and verification of their faith, and despite realizing that logic cannot deduce the rationality of faith, still make a "Leap of Faith" through passion to escape the meaninglessness of life and the state of *Abgrund* (abyss/groundlessness) of existence. (Søren Kierkegaard belongs to this category. If Liu Xiaofeng and Fan Meizhong can be considered Christians, they also belong here. The faith of so-called "Cultural Christians" basically falls into this category.)

&emsp;&emsp;In today's world, where metaphysics has collapsed and modern science reigns supreme, rational faith has largely lost its standing. The reason for the existence of passionate faith lies in the inquiry into existence caused by human curiosity, coupled with the emotional psychology that cannot bear the indifference of the cold world; thus, it possesses a characteristic that transcends the era.

&emsp;&emsp;2. The mainstream ideology of the social environment one inhabits endorses religion, and for certain purposes (maintaining tradition, political goals, etc.), mandatorily requires people in society to believe in religion. This leads the majority of people in that environment to become devout religious believers and consciously endorse religion. (For example, this situation existed in medieval Europe where religious regimes dominated.)

&emsp;&emsp;3. Consciously endorsing religion to gain secular benefits from it. (Tartuffe in Molière's *Tartuffe*, an artistic typification of a hypocritical religious figure, is an example.)

&emsp;&emsp;4. Superstitious Faith: Having unrealistic fantasies about religious faith (e.g., believing in miracles), fearing that a lack of religious faith will bring terrible consequences (e.g., fearing the Last Judgment), or wanting to gain posthumous benefits through religious faith (e.g., wanting to go to Heaven).

&emsp;&emsp;5. The mainstream ideology of the social environment endorses religion, possesses a long religious tradition, or the acceptance of religion makes it a part of daily life, leading people to follow the crowd in choosing religion. This unconscious endorsement does not make one a devout believer; it is merely superficial acceptance. In reality, those who make such an endorsement do not clearly understand what religion is really about. (For instance, in China, some people are forced to accept their spouse's religious faith when getting married, but in reality, these people do not become devout believers; they merely accept it on the surface.)

&emsp;&emsp;According to my understanding, the "true Christian faith" you mentioned in your lecture is what I referred to above as spiritual religious faith (specifically the Kierkegaardian passionate faith). In reality, as long as a person expresses "endorsement" of a religion, they will usually declare to the outside world that they believe in that religion (because not everyone likes to think deeply or study religious psychology thoroughly, and their understanding of so-called "faith" is general). The degree of their faith cannot be judged merely by the two words "I believe." In the West, which has religious traditions, how many of those who claim to be religious possess "true faith"? I do not know if any researchers have designed suitable scales to conduct statistical surveys on this, but it is certain that those with true "faith" are definitely not everyone. Before we have survey data, we can only analyze and think from a theoretical perspective.

&emsp;&emsp;Then I thought: Do Chinese people possess the conditions to become people with "true Christian faith"? You discussed the understanding of religion in traditional Chinese culture in your lecture. Indeed, nurtured by that cultural environment, it is unlikely for Chinese people to have that genuine Christian faith in the "other shore" and a transcendental God. But in our era, due to the fracture of traditional culture, the Chinese social environment clearly no longer possesses that thick traditional cultural atmosphere. With the convenience of information communication and economic globalization, Chinese citizens are learning more and more about Western culture. In reality, an ordinary citizen's understanding of Confucian culture may not be greater than their understanding of Marxism. Traditional culture does not have a significant impact on the religious faith of contemporary Chinese people (especially the common people); if there is a major influence, it should be the mainstream ideology that advocates science.

&emsp;&emsp;In China, if a person chooses religious faith, they are primarily not a supporter of the scientific worldview. The following is my examination of the psychology of why some believers choose a religious worldview over a scientific one:

&emsp;&emsp;In early September 2010, the British media, including *The Times*, revealed that in his new book *The Grand Design*, Stephen Hawking boldly "challenged" God, claiming that the Big Bang which created the universe was caused by inevitable laws of physics and did not require the help of God's power. Hawking's remarks caused a massive stir, and various religious figures came forward to refute, denounce, and criticize him.

&emsp;&emsp;The modern scientific system can fully provide answers to questions about the formation of the world without resorting to the concept of God. The scientific cosmic view has precise answers regarding the formation of the world; its system is vast and has been developing rapidly since the rise of modern science.

&emsp;&emsp;One possible reason why some believers choose a religious worldview rather than a scientific one lies in the difficulty of understanding science, which prevents them from incorporating scientific explanations into their worldview. Take cosmology, a branch of science closely related to worldviews, as an example: Cosmology as a scientific discipline is built upon a standard scientific language. Mastering scientific language requires extensive professional study and training. Participating in this professional study and training requires a lot of time, and more importantly, the learner must possess certain thinking abilities. (In fact, textbooks on mathematics and physics filled with mathematical symbols deter many people; even popular science books in these fields are considered dry and boring by many.) The motives for believing in religion can be diverse (whether finding the meaning of life or hoping to gain convenient living conditions through faith), just as the motives for engaging in scientific research are diverse (satisfying curiosity, gaining convenient living conditions, etc.). However, the difference is that the forms of religious faith can be diverse (believers can express their faith through prayer, regular worship, engaging in various religious activities, etc., and the concepts they believe in can be diverse—whether a transcendental God, a personified God, or other religious concepts), but scientific research must use a set of standard scientific languages and often requires the exclusion of subjective arbitrariness. (Some so-called "folk scientists" [amateur researchers] develop cognitive biases precisely because they are too obsessed with their own terminology and reject or belittle mainstream scientific views, making their arguments unpersuasive.) Often, faith does not make demands on knowledge and ability; what is required is a devout attitude.

&emsp;&emsp;Another possible reason is that the scientific worldview is not favored by religious believers because its use of scientific language, filled with cold data and lacking human touch, lacks emotional care. (This care is exactly what many religious faiths can give.) This need for emotion is also a psychological product of evolution. (Emotion helps communication among members within a species and gives psychological comfort to species members; thus, emotional mechanisms conducive to species survival were retained during evolution.) Rejecting emotional needs requires a mind that strongly prefers facts and data; people with such minds are an important part of the architects constructing the edifice of human civilization. Curiosity and skepticism are the basic psychological mechanisms that shake religious faith.

&emsp;&emsp;A final possible reason is herd mentality. If an individual lives in an environment full of a strong religious atmosphere, they may be deeply influenced by it and become a believer due to herd mentality. This herd mentality is formed by the individual seeking psychological shelter—firstly, if an individual's beliefs differ from those around them, they may be rejected and isolated, losing emotional sustenance; secondly, the religious concepts and value standards provided by believers around them are the most easily accessible and easy to implement. People with such herd mentality often lack the ability to think independently (which is also a manifestation of a lack of thinking ability); even if they come into contact with the scientific cosmic view, they are generally unmoved by it.

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the observations above, I believe that in China, religious believers (referring here to Christian believers) usually possess the following personality traits (though a specific believer may not possess all of them):

&emsp;&emsp;1. Lack of sufficient understanding of science.

&emsp;&emsp;2. Lack of speculative ability.

&emsp;&emsp;(Due to the above two points, religious believers cannot accept the scientific worldview and will not engage in philosophical speculative activities.)

&emsp;&emsp;3. Rich but fragile emotions, usually kind-hearted.

&emsp;&emsp;(Thus, they need to find spiritual sustenance in religion.)

&emsp;&emsp;4. Have the opportunity to come into contact with religion.

&emsp;&emsp;Points 1 and 2 can appear in any country. Even in developed Western countries with good education, not everyone understands science sufficiently or possesses enough speculative ability, because in reality, most people lack sufficient thinking capabilities. This is a species-level problem of *Homo sapiens*, not a national or regional one. (Global intelligence surveys can provide evidence for this. In fact, without survey data, our daily life experiences are enough to prove this.) The exception is "Cultural Christians," who possess good speculative ability, but because they lack a heart cold enough to face the *Abgrund* (abyss) state of existence without God, and are unwilling to accept the cold scientific worldview, they embark on the path of faith.

&emsp;&emsp;As for point 3, people with rich but fragile emotions also exist universally in all countries. Actually, personality is mainly determined by innate factors. (Research in behavioral genetics can provide evidence for this.)

&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, point 4 is the key to solving our problem (Do Chinese people possess the conditions to become people with "true Christian faith"?). Nowadays, Christian churches and groups are not rare in China. Although the "Regulations on Religious Affairs" restrict religious activities, in reality, there are still many ways to come into contact with religion. (During my time as a student, I have encountered missionaries many times, even in classrooms and dormitories.) Relevant data: In August 2010, the Institute of World Religions of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and other institutions released the 2010 *Annual Report on Religions in China* (Religious Blue Book) at the 3rd Contemporary Chinese Religion Forum. The book claimed that "the number of existing Christians in China accounts for about 1.8% of the total national population, with a total estimate of 23.05 million." (I estimate that superstitious believers and those who superficially accept it due to environmental needs make up a large proportion of this.) But in any case, China lacks the thick atmosphere of religious tradition found in the West, which is the reason why Chinese people rarely have faith nowadays. (As for the fact that people with "true faith" are always a minority among believers, this is a species-level problem of *Homo sapiens*, not a national or regional one.)

&emsp;&emsp;Your student believes that to get a more precise answer to this question, we still need to go deep into the populace to investigate, understand the status of Christian faith in China, and study the psychology of Chinese believers. Discussing only from theory inevitably falls into emptiness.

&emsp;&emsp;*Here I would like to cite relevant research and surveys from MBTI, a practical personality theory currently popular in the world, as reference material: MBTI theory suggests that INFX (Introversion + Intuition + Feeling + X, where X is Judging or Perceiving) people are most likely to become (spiritual) religious believers. According to relevant surveys (various statistical data are available online if you are interested), INF types account for about 3% of the US population.

&emsp;&emsp;A special case, my observation of a Christian:

&emsp;&emsp;(Currently) I have a classmate, a girl from Qingdao, Shandong. Her MBTI type is INFP. She is introverted and shy, has a low excitement threshold (easily agitated), and has rich emotions but is relatively self-centered. Her intelligence is above average. She loves art, literature, and religion, cares particularly about others' opinions of her, and is very sensitive to interpersonal relationships. Because she is not good at communicating with classmates, and because the classmates are basically relatively "secular" (in Aristotle's words: they love the life of enjoyment of the masses), this classmate became out of place with the collective. Finally, she could only turn to religion and find spiritual comfort in faith in God. Her faith belongs to the first type of passionate faith I summarized above.

&emsp;&emsp;(As a rationalist, I cannot personally empathize with her piety towards God. However, as someone who is also out of place with the collective and has a low excitement threshold, I am her only friend in the class. Because she is extremely defensive of her faith, I cannot discuss religious issues with her. Also, because she lacks sufficient scientific literacy and philosophical speculative ability, I cannot instill scientific and philosophical knowledge in her; I can only give her comfort emotionally.)

&emsp;&emsp;I have another question: Can religious faith improve human creativity? In your lecture, you said that true (religious) faith can improve human creativity. Your student expresses deep doubt about this. To answer whether religious faith can improve creativity, we must answer: Where does creativity come from?

&emsp;&emsp;So-called creativity usually refers to the ability to create material wealth and spiritual wealth. People generally recognized as creative include scientists, philosophers, artists, inventors, etc. Creativity is closely related to the desire for exploration (curiosity, skepticism), high intelligence (logical reasoning ability, linguistic ability, etc.), and strong sensitivity (including the experience of emotions and the ability to perceive external information). High intelligence and strong sensitivity are limited by genetic factors on the one hand, and by the acquired environment on the other. (In fact, these personality traits are mainly determined by innate factors; behavioral genetics research can provide evidence for this.) Can religious faith enhance creativity? It is certain that it could in medieval Europe, where monks were among the few who had the right to education and were the masters and disseminators of culture. (Therefore, at that time, if one wanted to be cultured, one had to believe in religion.) But in the 21st century today, does religious faith have any special help in improving creativity? Our ways to improve creativity are very diverse: receiving school education, contacting creative people, participating in practical activities that cultivate creativity, etc. How many highly creative people today are religious believers? Isn't the skepticism related to creativity contrary to faith? Obviously, God as a hypostatized concept cannot have superpowers to suddenly increase a believer's creativity. Can we understand it this way: A possible way for religious faith to improve creativity is—giving people hope in life, prompting people to engage in creative activities in life.

&emsp;&emsp;The above are some of your student's humble opinions. I hope for Professor Deng's guidance.
