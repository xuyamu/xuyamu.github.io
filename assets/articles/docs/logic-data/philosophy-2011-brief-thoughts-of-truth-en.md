　　Recently, Brother Runner (a PhD in Mathematics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences) asked me about my understanding of truth. So, I organized my thoughts on this matter and compiled them into the following text:

### I. Popular Understandings of Truth

　　I would like to start by discussing the popular understanding of truth. Understanding how the general public perceives truth helps us understand the formation process of the human grasp of the concept of truth. All complex viewpoints are built upon reflection and criticism of simple viewpoints, and the formation of simple viewpoints is also an indispensable part of the process of understanding. Since human thinking develops constantly during growth, a person's understanding of the concept of truth also tends to become clearer and more complex as their thinking ability strengthens. At the same time, the human cultural environment plays an extremely important role in a person's understanding of the concept of truth; every era has various different understandings of truth. Examining a concept requires a process of association, and association is built upon the ability to associate and thinking materials (specifically, various memories). Examining an abstract concept like truth is not something everyone can do, because many people have poor associative abilities and lack relevant thinking materials. If you were to grab a random Passerby A on the street and ask, "How do you understand truth?" they would likely be stunned immediately and completely unable to understand what you are saying. How rare are those who seriously think about the problem of truth (generally speaking)!

　　Truth is generally understood as correct principles, and principles are expressed through language; therefore, the form of expression of truth is generally language or text. However, truth is sometimes also broadly referred to as certain actually existing phenomena or the nature of things, etc. I once surveyed some people around me about their understanding of truth and collected some naive viewpoints. The following is a display of the naive viewpoints regarding the understanding of truth that I collected, along with my explanation for their formation:

1. **"Truth is what one sees with their own eyes as real."**
   　　There is a saying: "Seeing is believing, hearing is false" (Eye-witnessing is real, ear-hearing is void). According to Russell's view, all our knowledge can be divided into two types: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. What is seen with the eyes is knowledge by acquaintance, while what is heard with the ears is knowledge by description. We have experienced many cognitive errors caused by believing others' descriptions; this daily experience tells us that acquaintance is more reliable than description. At the same time, our educators often teach people to see and do things for themselves, which strengthens people's affirmation of acquaintance. The reasons listed above likely played an important role in the process of some people forming the understanding of truth mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph. This naive view of truth is the initial form of the **Correspondence Theory of Truth** in philosophy, which began to form since Aristotle.

   　　People holding this simple view often fail to consider that, in fact, most of the things we know are not derived from acquaintance, and many correct things we believe in daily life are known to us through knowledge by description. Furthermore, we need to consider here: what kind of understanding counts as "acquaintance"? According to common understanding, sensing personally with the five senses counts as acquaintance, right? But does observation with instruments count as acquaintance? What exactly must we do to understand "real things"? If truth must be known by acquaintance, then truth would be different for everyone, because the things everyone is acquainted with are different. Therefore, this view implies that truth is not absolute. However, it does not rule out that those holding this view take it for granted that although the things everyone is acquainted with are different, as long as it is acquaintance, the understanding of a thing and the conclusions drawn are the same. The Correspondence Theory of Truth, which considers propositions that correspond to reality as truth, obviously presupposes some constant, immutable reality and that we have the ability to know this reality; otherwise, the relationship of correspondence and its judgment criteria would be invalid. (If there is no constant, immutable reality and we do not have the ability to know this reality, then we cannot know whether we have truly found propositions that correspond to reality, because we cannot be certain whether our judgment criteria are adaptable to a changing reality.)

   　　Here, I will briefly mention my understanding of Popper's falsification theory: Popper's falsification theory believes that scientific exploration proceeds through the continuous criticism and negation of hypotheses. At first glance, it seems that Popper's falsification theory also presupposes an immutable reality (or truth), and we constantly advance towards truth by constantly negating our errors. But in reality, our judgment of existing scientific hypotheses is still based on our existing logic. It is better to say that Popper's falsification theory has more of the color of the **Coherence Theory of Truth** than the traditional Correspondence Theory (which believes propositions conforming to reality are truth). (Searle mentioned in *The Future of Philosophy* that scientists who are interested in the philosophy of science and respect Popper have basically misunderstood Popper. Is this really the case?)

   　　I would also like to mention some of my thoughts on the formation process of the Correspondence Theory of Truth from the perspective of evolution: In order to adapt to the cruel natural environment, humans had to evolve physiological structures capable of adapting to the survival environment. The ability to explore and recognize the world, evolved by humans under the promotion of various factors, helped humans achieve today's civilization. The will to "clearly recognize the world and find the essence of the world" obviously helped humans recognize the world more clearly and enabled humans to survive better; therefore, nature retained it during evolution. Incidentally, evolutionary psychology has a view that the distinction between men as hunters and women as gatherers in primitive society influenced the spatial abilities of men and women. This probably explains the reason for the phenomenon that the number of male mathematicians is far greater than that of female mathematicians. (For details, please see: D.M. Buss, *Evolutionary Psychology*, Chapter 3: Overcoming the Hostile Forces of Nature).

2. **"Truth is with God."**
   　　A Christian told me this viewpoint. One of the important reasons why some religious believers are steadfast in their religious beliefs lies in their lack of curiosity and skepticism. They do not ask what truth is but simply link truth with God to maintain their beliefs. The reason they say "Truth is with God" instead of "Truth is with the Devil" is that in the context of daily life, "truth" is regarded as high-level and noble. In the eyes of believers, something as high-level as truth (whatever it is) should naturally be with the supreme God. As for what truth exactly is, what God is, and how exactly truth is with God, they do not investigate deeply.

3. **"Truth is something absolutely correct."**
   　　In our culture, truth is usually considered to be correct things. Its linguistic structure makes people think of "real principles" (real, in turn, makes people connect to absolute). Moreover, as I mentioned before, in the context of daily life, "truth" is regarded as high-level and noble. Therefore, interpreting truth strictly as "something absolutely correct" is also a viewpoint that is relatively easy to think of (but has not been carefully scrutinized). Regarding the thinking mode of judging things as "correct" and "incorrect," I feel it has a lot to do with the psychology humans evolved to adapt to the survival environment. To survive, humans must make judgments about the environment before them and must make "correct" or "wrong" judgments about their own concepts; otherwise, it is difficult to adapt to the ever-changing natural environment. (If it were not for the immense survival pressure brought by the extremely harsh natural environment, humans would not have evolved such a complex brain. During the bottlenecks of human evolution, humans were once on the verge of extinction; it was their powerful creativity and observation that saved their race.)

   　　"Truth is something absolutely correct." This viewpoint can be subdivided into two types:
   * **(1). "Truth exists, and truth is something absolutely correct."** People holding this view have not examined the way people use "correct." Once we realize that people's standards for judging "correctness or lack thereof" are different, we have to consider whether there is any "something absolutely correct," and we also have to doubt the existence of truth.
   * **(2). "Regardless of whether truth exists or not, truth is something absolutely correct anyway."** Even if there is no such thing as absolute correctness, people can still say "truth is something absolutely correct," only in this case, truth becomes a completely empty concept.

   　　*The naive viewpoints I mention here refer to viewpoints that have not been carefully considered. People with a naive understanding of truth often cannot provide a detailed defense of their views but only have a vague consciousness about truth.*

### II. The Formation and Change of My Understanding of "Truth"

　　Speaking of the understanding of a concept, we must examine the user's way of using that concept, because often, the way a concept is used is precisely the embodiment of the user's understanding of that concept.

　　I am not clear exactly when I started using the word "truth," but what is certain is that by junior high school, I began to use this word frequently in my essays. Let me list some sentences involving truth that I commonly used during my middle school years and the related interpretation of my understanding of truth:

　　"I love truth."
　　"Exploring truth is the fundamental purpose of mankind." (Grandpa Jiang Xikui said this sentence when he appeared on the *Masters* [Da Jia] program. I burst into tears immediately upon hearing it; scientist grandpas are the most adorable!)

　　These are two sentences involving truth that I used frequently. First, let me explain my motivation for saying these two sentences: These two sentences might have been spoken to others, usually for the sake of stating a stance, or they might have been spoken to myself in my heart, usually out of self-encouragement and the will to clarify my goals.

　　These two sentences embody my affirmation of the sentiment of loving truth and the act of exploring truth. The love for truth and the affirmation of the act of exploring truth that I expressed when using these two sentences were not built upon a clear understanding of the concept of truth. (In this sentence of mine, "clear" is an adjective I use to judge the degree of my understanding of something; clear means I have a set of viewpoints regarding a certain thing that satisfies me. In fact, when I first started using the vocabulary "truth," I could not explain clearly what truth was myself, but merely used it according to conventional usage. I will explain the process of how I learned to use this concept below.)

　　I once thought that I loved truth and declared to the outside world that I was married to truth. The reasons why I developed this idea lie in:

**1. Because I am naturally curious**, I have loved reading and thinking since childhood. Reading and thinking are usually considered ways to obtain truth, so I thought I was pursuing truth. I delighted in reading and thinking, so I thought I also delighted in pursuing truth.

**2. I admired and agreed with those who were labeled as "pursuing truth."** I was inspired by their spirit, so their words and deeds had a certain influence on me. Many of them claimed to love truth or even claimed to be married to truth (for example, the ancient Greek female mathematician Hypatia and the French female mathematician Germain). Their words and deeds could influence me primarily because I admired and agreed with their words and deeds. The reason I admired and agreed with those labeled as "pursuing truth," as I mentioned earlier, is mainly that I admired and agreed with their words and deeds. I admired them because:

* **(1). I understood them.**
  　　Understanding is the prerequisite for accurate judgment. Since I am relatively rigorous and take a responsible attitude toward my own words and deeds, I do not arbitrarily judge things I do not understand. Moreover, if I do not understand something, I cannot judge whether that thing is worth my love. If I cannot make a judgment on whether it is worth my love, I will not casually like it. Therefore, it is impossible to claim that I like something I completely do not understand.

  　　"Understanding" is an abstract concept, and its use in daily life is relatively general. So, what do I mean by "understanding" here? I will examine my definition of "understanding" in different contexts here. (Since I am analyzing my own psychology, I must give my own thoughts, and my definition is the expression of my views. But given that I am a member of the *Homo sapiens* species and possess the linguistic ability universally possessed by *Homo sapiens*, my definition still has a certain universality. When analyzing "understanding," I will first give typical daily expressions representing a certain type of usage of understanding and then analyze them specifically.):

  * **① "You don't understand a girl's heart at all!"** — Usually, understanding in this context refers to the forgiveness or approval of a certain emotion. Under what circumstances do we sympathize with others' emotions? I think the situations can be roughly divided into two types:
    * I. We can experience a certain emotion of others, and our values tend to make a positive evaluation of that emotion, thus expressing forgiveness or approval of others' emotions.
    * II. We cannot experience a certain emotion of others, but under the influence of certain values, we make a positive evaluation of this emotion of others, thus expressing forgiveness or approval of others' emotions.
  * **② "Have you understood this knowledge point?"** — Usually, understanding in this context refers to the mastery of concepts and thinking modes. The characteristic of this understanding is: being able to use the understood concept or so-called knowledge point to solve problems and being able to explain it in one's own language. (And because the depth of understanding varies, the usage situations of the understood concepts are also diverse. At the same time, the seemingly effective use of concepts under misunderstood circumstances is also inevitable.)

  　　I roughly divide the usage of understanding into these two categories. These two uses of understanding are relatively common. Of course, given the limitations of my analytical level, my classification may be relatively general.

* **(2). They are similar to me.**
  　　According to psychological research, people tend to admire those who are similar to themselves because this helps in harmonious survival. Here, the similarity I speak of refers mainly to similarities in personality and experience.
  　　Specific points of similarity include:
  * **Personality aspects:** Good at thinking, fond of reading, possessing a skeptical spirit, holding idealistic concepts (here, in terms of popular understanding, i.e., pursuing some ideal beliefs that are difficult for ordinary people to pursue and which they do not pursue; the ideals here often possess the nature of being difficult to realize), etc.
  * **Personal experience:** The most important point is not being understood. (I remember that in junior high school, I often used precursors who were not understood, such as Copernicus and Galileo, as examples. I felt they were like my own kind.)

　　But the premise of my statement (this is a presupposition I made in my subconscious) is:

1. **Truth exists.** (I thought I should love things that exist; this thinking led me to doubt the existence of gods like God or the Creator since childhood.)
2. **Truth is attainable.** (I thought: If truth cannot be attained, isn't my pursuit in vain? Things that are in vain are not worth my doing.)

　　However, with the deepening of thinking (the deepening of my thinking benefited from continuous learning on the one hand, and from the enhancement of abstract thinking ability brought by the continuous development of brain structure with age on the other), my love for truth suffered a blow.

　　The blow to my love for truth was caused by the questioning of the premises of my love for truth:

**1. Does truth really exist?**
　　My initial understanding of the concept of truth basically belonged to the traditional Correspondence Theory (referring to propositions conforming to reality being truth). It was Schopenhauer who first shattered my dream of the Correspondence Theory. (Schopenhauer believed that our understanding of the world is always subjective.) The contradiction between the thirst for knowledge and the fact of unknowability shook my initial understanding and pursuit of truth.
(By the way, back in the day, it was Hume who interrupted Kant's dogmatic slumber, and Kant greatly influenced Schopenhauer...)

**2. Is truth attainable?**
　　The absolute truth I initially envisioned (unchanging eternal principles and the fundamental nature of things) had been negated with the disillusionment of the Correspondence Theory ideal of propositions conforming to reality (because I finally discovered the huge gap between propositions and reality and realized the limitations of human cognitive ability) and the deconstruction of original values (pursuing values like kindness and peace). I had to think about what truth is.

　　Thus, the absolute truth I originally loved has been negated. The word "truth," due to different understandings, has very diverse meanings and is difficult to satisfy precise discussion. Therefore, to avoid ambiguity, I am now relatively cautious in using it. If I say "I love truth" now, it refers to "I love exploring truth" (i.e., loving observation and thinking).

　　There are also many discussions about truth in philosophy (Correspondence Theory of Truth, Coherence Theory of Truth, Pragmatic Theory of Truth, Semantic Theory of Truth, etc.), all explaining truth from different angles. I am currently still an outsider looking in, daring not to make critical comments.

　　The above humble opinions, which cannot grace the halls of great elegance, are partly written in the past and partly written newly. They are all the fruits of my daily thoughts. If there are absurdities, criticism is welcome.
