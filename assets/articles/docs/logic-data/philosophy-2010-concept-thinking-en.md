**I. Regarding the Definition and Basic Components of Concepts**
　　What is a concept? A concept refers to an abstract, universal idea or notion. The communication and expression of ideas or notions inevitably involve language. Therefore, these concepts are expressed by linguistic symbols and are used for communication.

　　The Basic Components of a Concept:
Here, allow me to borrow two concepts from Saussurean linguistics: "Signifier" (能指) and "Signified" (所指). Since the traditional definitions of "Signifier" and "Signified" have been deconstructed by Derrida, I will temporarily place a definitional limitation on "Signifier" and "Signified" here; otherwise, borrowing these two concepts will not achieve the expressive effect I desire. This definitional limitation is: The "Signifier" refers to the fixed written symbols and corresponding sound symbols that represent a certain concept; the "Signified" refers to the thing pointed to by that written symbol (including sensory impressions and consciousness). The elucidation of a concept that has fixed written symbols and corresponding sound symbols (using *other* written symbols and corresponding sound symbols) does not belong to the "Signifier," but belongs to the "Signified." This definitional limitation is intended to avoid the mutual conversion of "Signifier" and "Signified" (using linguistic symbols to describe the "Signified" thereby making it a "Signifier") which leads to deconstruction.
&emsp;&emsp;Here, the connection between the "Signifier" and the "Signified" is artificially stipulated; there is no necessary connection.
&emsp;&emsp;Precisely because the connection between the "Signifier" and the "Signified" is artificially stipulated and lacks a necessary bond, communication between people leads to various divergences and misunderstandings due to differing understandings of linguistic symbols. These divergences and misunderstandings not only aggravate the difficulty of interpersonal communication but are also one of the sources of chaos in philosophical research. (Analytic philosophy, conversely, focuses on clearing up this chaos.) Relatively speaking, mathematical and logical symbols are far more precise than everyday linguistic symbols and the language used in the humanities.

　　Based on the above, I analyze the basic components of a concept as follows:
The "Signifier" of a concept: The fixed written symbols and corresponding sound symbols that represent the concept.
The "Signified" of a concept: The thing associated with the "Signifier," including sensory impressions, consciousness, and other written symbols and corresponding sound symbols used to elucidate the fixed written symbols and corresponding sound symbols representing the concept.

**II. An Examination of the Formation of the Understanding of Concepts**
　　The process of forming an understanding of a concept is divided into three steps:
1. Knowledge of the specific "Signifier" and "Signified" of a concept:
That is, the perception, realization, and memory of the fixed written symbols and corresponding sound symbols representing the concept. It includes knowledge of the thing associated with the signifier, including the experience of sensory feelings, which then transform into consciousness and memory.
2. The establishment of the corresponding link between the specific "Signifier" and "Signified":
Since the connection between the "Signifier" and the "Signified" is artificially stipulated and has no necessary connection, establishing the corresponding link is the second step.
3. Understanding the connections and applications between different concepts:
The application of a concept is not isolated but is built upon the connections between different concepts. This connection and application rely on the ability to understand and the learning of experience.

**III. Regarding the "Vulgar Understanding" of Concepts**
　　What I call "Vulgar Understanding" (流俗理解) refers to a mode of understanding concepts held by the masses (who do not engage in abstract speculation). The characteristics of this mode of understanding are: generalized, imprecise, following the crowd, and rooted in a specific cultural context.
The most basic function of language lies in communication. For the masses who do not engage in abstract speculation, daily linguistic exchange rarely involves abstract concepts. When they are compelled to use abstract concepts, their grasp is often inadequate, and their understanding of these abstract concepts tends to be vulgar.
"Vulgar" is a relative description. It is relative because: firstly, human intellectual achievements differ across different historical stages; secondly, the judgment of what is "vulgar" or not inevitably carries personal bias. The reason personal bias is unavoidable is that:
1. There is a lack of a unified standard of judgment.
2. Personal knowledge is limited, leading to inevitable partiality.
But generally speaking, in the absence of specialized knowledge, the understanding of a specific concept usually falls into the category of "Vulgar Understanding."

**IV. An Examination of the Vulgar Understanding of Concepts such as "Matter," "Spirit," "Reason," and "Sensibility"**

**Matter**
　　There are usually two types of vulgar understanding:
1. The material basis of survival: All substances required for food, drink, housing, and transportation (but excluding consciousness). The cause of the formation of this vulgar understanding lies in the failure to realize that consciousness also has a material basis. (To speak of the material basis of survival is already to admit the existence of matter; material reality is a basic presupposition, so there is no issue of idealism here.) Common statements such as "transcending matter to reach a certain spiritual realm" use "Matter" based on this vulgar understanding.
2. The matter constituting the world (generalized understanding): All substantialized understandings of simple ideas regarding the matter that constitutes the world (for example, a naive view of cosmic ontology) and the belief in the existence of concrete matter and the world belong to this type of understanding. It is called vulgar because (those holding this understanding) lack a precise grasp of the world picture; such a precise grasp is established upon a precise mastery of natural science.

**Spirit**
　　There are usually two types of vulgar understanding:
1. Human consciousness as opposed to Matter (of the two vulgar types above). The cause of the formation of this vulgar understanding also lies in the failure to realize that consciousness also has a material basis.
2. Noble value concepts. Statements such as "this person pursues spirit rather than matter" use "Spirit" based on this vulgar understanding. The formation of this understanding lies in the influence of an ideology that devalues animalistic behavior aimed at one's own survival while elevating altruistic behavior and the value of possessing complex thoughts and ideas.

**Reason**
　　The usual vulgar understanding is:
　　Characterized by an attitude or personality of being calm, organized, realistic (seeking truth from facts), etc.
This understanding is formed through the observation and simple classification of people in reality, influenced by opinions widely circulated in society. (People with this understanding usually consider artists and the like to be entirely "sensible/emotional"; in reality, this lacks detailed and serious examination. They usually think rational people lack passion and are cold and unfeeling.)

**Sensibility**
　　The usual vulgar understanding is:
　　Characterized by an attitude or personality of being impulsive, acting on emotion, or considering human feelings and relationships when acting.
　　Similarly, this understanding is also formed through the observation and simple classification of people in reality, influenced by opinions widely circulated in society.
　　(Regarding the vulgar understanding of these two opposing concepts, "Reason" and "Sensibility," they can be applied well enough in daily communication. However, when discussing complex issues, they become insufficient or cause confusion. For example: Is *bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind* considered rational or sensible? Is Utilitarianism, which takes the interests of the majority as the highest goal, considered rational or sensible?)
