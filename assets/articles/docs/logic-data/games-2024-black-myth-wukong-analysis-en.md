　　While playing the game, I noticed several inconsistencies in the narrative. In my October post, "Psychological Analysis of Erlang Shen and Related Plot Analysis in Black Myth: Wukong" (a 30,000-word piece), I briefly touched upon these issues. Lately, while taking anti-aging supplements alongside various nootropics, I’ve found myself even more sensitive to plot holes. I’ll be diving into those details more thoroughly here.

　　As for the characterization of Sun Wukong, I’ve already provided a detailed breakdown in my "Black Myth: Wukong Plot Analysis" (over 10,000 words), so I won’t repeat it here.

　　This article will focus on the illogical aspects of the Black Myth: Wukong storyline, including loose political organization, "intelligence-nerfed" character behavior, the downgrading of character roles, and shallow power struggles.

</div>

　　**Black Myth: Wukong Plot Outline:** After being conferred the title of "Victorious Fighting Buddha" upon completing the journey to the West, Sun Wukong leaves Mount Lingshan to retire on Mount Huaguo. However, his unauthorized departure is intolerable to the Celestial Court. Consequently, the Court dispatches an army to besiege Wukong and Mount Huaguo, with Erlang Shen as the commander and the Black Bear Guai, Yellow Wind Sage, Yellowbrow, Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master, and Bull King serving as vanguard generals. During the battle, Wukong discovers that the Golden Hoop remains on his head. In a moment of desperation, while attempting to remove the hoop, he lets down his guard and is forced into "Bingjie" (physical dissolution). Following this, Erlang Shen oversees the distribution of the spoils, dividing Wukong's "Six Roots" among the Great Yaos: the Black Bear Guai receives *Craving Eyes*, the Yellow Wind Sage receives *Fuming Ears*, Yellowbrow receives *Enraptured Nose*, the Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master receives *Envious Tongue*, and the Bull King receives *Worried Body*. Erlang Shen privately keeps the sixth root, *Freed Mind*.

　　After Wukong's demise, his reincarnation—the "Destined One"—embarks on a new journey to the West to collect the relics and resurrect the Great Sage. If the Destined One only retrieves five relics from the Yao Kings, he will defeat the "Great Sage’s Broken Shell" at Mount Huaguo only to be forced back into the Golden Hoop by the Elder Monkey. However, if the player completes Erlang Shen's secret questline ("Melody in the Mire"), defeats Erlang Shen at Mount Mei, and obtains the sixth relic (*Freed Mind*), they can then face the Great Sage's Broken Shell without accepting the fate of the hoop, successfully resurrecting as the true Sun Wukong.

　　The game is divided into six chapters: 
1. *Autumn Shades, Black Cloud* (Black Wind Mountain)
2. *Yellow Sand, Desolate Dusk* (Yellow Wind Ridge)
3. *White Snow, Ice Retained* (The New West)
4. *The End of the Web* (The Webbed Hollow)
5. *Golden Child, Burning Heart* (Flaming Mountains)
6. *Unfinished Business* (Mount Huaguo)

　　After defeating the final boss of the first five chapters, the Destined One retrieves five relics. The sixth, *Freed Mind*, is obtained after defeating Erlang Shen at Mount Mei via the Pagoda Realm in the New West.

**This narrative structure serves gameplay utility first and foremost:**

　　1. **Character Progression:** Killing Sun Wukong at the start so the player controls the Destined One allows for a traditional RPG growth and leveling process.
　　2. **Modular Storytelling:** Dividing the game into six chapters with relatively independent stories lowers the complexity of the narrative design. It keeps the main objective clear and helps players manage the game's pacing.

　　In the eyes of producer Feng Ji, one specific sequence is of paramount importance: "Sun Wukong vs. Erlang Shen." In an interview with *Southern People Weekly* titled *"Dialogue with Feng Ji: When You Are at the Peak of Confidence, You Are Also at the Abyss of Ignorance,"* he stated that this fight is the very "soul" of *Black Myth: Wukong*. Feng Ji held the somewhat peculiar view that as long as this fight was executed well, the game would not suffer from widespread negative reviews or total failure. However, players obviously don't use a single boss fight as their primary metric for a negative review. Generally, players judge a game based on its overall elements—gameplay, art, and narrative. It is highly unlikely for a player to decide against a negative review solely because of one boss fight. Feng Ji’s stance merely highlights his personal obsession with the Wukong vs. Erlang showdown.

　　In *Black Myth: Wukong*, Erlang Shen’s faction operates independently from both the Celestial Court and Mount Lingshan. As supporters of Sun Wukong, the members of this faction secretly plot his resurrection and are distributed across the game's maps to push the plot forward.

　　The narrative setting is also deeply tied to the development team's preferences. The core creators at Game Science were the producers of *Asura* (Dou Zhan Shen), which was based on the novel *Wukong Biographies*. In both *Asura* and *Wukong Biographies*, the Celestial Court and Mount Lingshan are framed as the antagonists, while Sun Wukong is portrayed as a heroic figure seeking freedom and rebelling against their oppression. *Black Myth: Wukong* continues this trope, which provides a convenient justification for Wukong's death.

</div>

### Loose Political Organization

　　The "Portrait" lore entry for Erlang Shen describes the scene where Sun Wukong's Roots were distributed as spoils:

> "Just a bunch of monkeys; not a single decent trinket among them."
> 
> Celestial Soldier A complained to Soldier B as he used his spear to flip over a corpse. Before them lay the recently ravaged Mount Huaguo—rocks sheared and chipped, ancient trees charred black by lightning, and a landscape carpeted with remains.
> 
> "The good stuff is all in the Water Curtain Cave. How would the likes of us get a turn at scavenging the battlefield?" Soldier B replied.
> 
> "True. We’re stuck with the dirty work—finishing off the ones still breathing." With that, Soldier A thrust his spear into a body and pulled it back out.
> 
> They continued their grim task methodically until they reached a massive boulder.
> 
> Soldier A tapped the rock. Soldier B remarked, "It’s just a rock. You expecting to squeeze oil out of it?"
> 
> Soldier A asked, "You didn't know? This is Sun Wukong’s remains."
> 
> Soldier B scoffed, "Nonsense! Isn't he gone?"
> 
> "He died in battle earlier, and his Six Roots were divided. He was born from a stone; now that his spirit roots are gone, he’s naturally turned back into one."
> 
> "Bullsh*t."
> 
> Soldier A said proudly, "I was at the front of the formation and saw it clearly. When they dismembered him, even the True Lord took a piece."
> 
> Soldier B was surprised: "I don't remember you being at the front... Really? Even the True Lord took one? I saw those Yaos from the lower realm show up; I thought only monsters would take a monster’s things."
> 
> "What 'monster'? He was a conferred Buddha," Soldier A corrected him.
> 
> "Why would the True Lord take that? Isn't it bad luck?"
> 
> "Who knows. Wukong was a spiritual being born of heaven and earth; maybe eating it provides a boost." Both laughed.
> 
> "Hey, look at this." Soldier B noticed a flash of pure white beside the rock.
> 
> They picked it up—a sprig of plum blossom, jade-like and snowy, in full bloom.
> 
> Soldier A wondered, "How could there be plum blossoms on Mount Huaguo?"
> 
> Soldier B said, "This looks a bit like..."
> 
> Before he could finish, a spearhead erupted through his chest. A flash of golden light followed, and even the soul within his armor dissipated.
> 
> Soldier A was terrified, but before he could speak, the golden light flashed again.
> 
> Beneath the drifting clouds, Mount Huaguo returned to silence.

　　From the prologue and the animated short *The Unfinished*, we know that the Celestial Court's forces included Erlang Shen, five Great Yaos, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the celestial host.

　　The Portrait entry reveals that when Erlang Shen distributed the Six Roots, common soldiers were actually standing around watching. Who on earth decided on this method of "splitting the loot"?

　　1.  **If Erlang Shen decided it:** It shows poor judgment. If he intended to secretly keep the Mind Root (the Sixth Root), wouldn't a public distribution make it impossible to hide his theft?
　　2.  **If the Celestial Court decided it:** Why would they establish such a bizarre and rare distribution model where leaders divide the spoils while common soldiers get nothing but are forced to watch?

　　Soldiers A and B are clearly low-ranking grunts. Allowing them to witness such a high-stakes distribution is inherently illogical. The disposal of "spoils" like Wukong's Six Roots should involve complex political maneuvering within the Court. To have them distributed on the front lines without high-level oversight, auditing, or formal inventory is both irrational and sloppy. This behavior—distributing strategic assets in public—resembles a loose alliance of rebels or bandits rather than the organized, formal military of a centralized government.

　　Furthermore, a major question arises: Did Erlang Shen take Wukong’s **Mind Root** at that moment? According to the soldiers, it seems so, as they mention the "Six Roots being divided." If he took the Mind Root then and there, he was essentially declaring himself a traitor in broad daylight. Keeping the Mind Root was not part of the Court's plan (as the Elder Monkey says: *"After the Great Sage died, five of the Six Roots remained and were taken by the Yao Kings, but the 'Mind' was lost."*). If he didn't take the Mind Root but just a random piece of Wukong's body, why? As a souvenir? Or to eat it, as the soldiers joked? Even if it were a souvenir, shouldn't he have done it privately? Why do it so openly as to leave a trail of evidence? And since we know these soldiers saw it, how could he be sure no others did? Did Erlang not consider the consequences? 

**The risks of taking the Mind Root publicly include:**
　　1.  Savvy celestial officers might recognize it as the Mind Root. If they are aware of the plan to keep the Destined One in check (via the Golden Hoop), they might report Erlang to the higher-ups once Wukong's resurrection begins.
　　2.  The rumor would spread. If the theft of the Mind Root becomes an open secret, it ceases to be the "hidden master plan" depicted in the game.

　　In short, "looting a corpse in public" is a move fraught with infinite risks for Erlang and reflects a total lack of discipline and organization for the Celestial Court.

　　A slightly more rational explanation—though still weak—is that Erlang took a piece of the body publicly as a distraction while hiding the Mind Root privately. But why not hide the "souvenir" too? Doing it publicly only invites ridicule and rumors about him "eating" his rival. Once the grunts start gossiping, it eventually reaches the ears of the high command. How would the "True Lord" save face then? To successfully hide the Mind Root, Erlang should have distanced himself from the distribution entirely and "proven" to the Court that the Mind Root had simply vanished.

　　Moreover, this military operation seemingly lacked a **Military Monitor (监军)**. In traditional Chinese governance, a monitor is a central official sent to supervise armies in the field. Erlang and the five Yaos aren't monitors (they aren't even Court officials), and the common soldiers are too low-rank. Do the Four Heavenly Kings count? A monitor usually represents the core of power, holds high status, and is close to the Emperor—and typically doesn't join the fray. This campaign desperately needed one, as the commander (Erlang) and his vanguards (the five Yaos) do not belong to the Court. Their loyalty is inherently questionable—especially Erlang, who was Wukong's "brother." The Court forced Erlang to turn against his friend; is the Jade Emperor so foolish as to not send a trusted confidant to watch him? Does the Court not know of their history? If so, their intelligence system is a disaster.

　　During their fight, Erlang and Wukong even reminisce. Wukong teases him as "Good Brother" and claims Erlang is the only one besides Bajie who can make him laugh. Great—now every soldier in earshot knows how close you two are. (One could argue the Elder Monkey made these dialogues up, but if we take the scene at face value, the Court should have immediately suspected collusion.)

　　Is it possible Erlang stole the Mind Root elsewhere? Perhaps. But this is the only description in the entire game regarding the event, and it implies the roots were taken during the distribution. Without any mention of a clever ruse or a stealthy heist, it simply makes the Celestial Court look disorganized and Erlang look reckless.

　　On one hand, the narrative paints the Celestial Court as a ruthless antagonist that oppresses its own and the world alike; on the other hand, it fails to depict the administrative competence such a regime would require, instead exposing a chaotic and poorly managed bureaucracy.

### Character "Intelligence Nerfing"

**[The Destined One]**

　　The persona of the Destined One (Sun Wukong's reincarnation) is essentially an emotionless "rookie" whose primary problem-solving method is "hit first, talk never." One could argue that because he isn't the *complete* reincarnation of Wukong, he lacks the original's wit and strategic mind. I’ll give him a pass for now.

**[Erlang Shen]**

　　Erlang Shen is the other core figure in the game besides Wukong/The Destined One. His "Portrait" entry describes him as a "Great Talent acclaimed across the heavens," and he certainly views himself as a genius. One of his lines is: *"Among those mediocrities in the Heavens, many are inferior to me, and few are my equal."* But does his actual performance live up to this hype?

　　First, let’s look at whether Erlang’s dialogue reflects a "genius" persona. (I will analyze his actual deeds in the "Character Role Downgrade" section later.)

　　After the Destined One defeats Erlang, he delivers this speech:

> "Since that battle, **until today, I finally understand...**"
> "A lifetime of fame could not lock him down."
> "A golden hoop could not trap him."
> "Trading the death of the flesh for the eternity of the mind."

　　When I saw this, I literally laughed out loud. "Listen, buddy, Wukong has been dead for centuries. You make it sound like he died just last month. Is your 'processing speed' as slow as Flash the Sloth?"

<figure>
    <img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/blackmyth/sloth.webp">
    <figcaption>Flash the Sloth from "Zootopia," known for doing and saying everything incredibly slowly. (Source: Internet)</figcaption>
</figure>

　　Erlang has another line that further highlights his sluggish thinking:

> "When I was practicing the Tao in years past, my Master often said that 'The perfect shut requires no bolt yet cannot be opened; the perfect knot requires no rope yet cannot be untied.' **Now, I finally understand** that the only thing binding us is ourselves."

　　Being slow on the uptake is not exactly a hallmark of a "genius." If the writers wanted to highlight his intellect, his dialogue should make him appear confident, sharp, and possessing foresight.

　　Allow me to revise Erlang's lines so he doesn't sound like he has a five-hundred-year lag:

> "**Ever since that battle, I have known...**"
> "A lifetime of fame could not lock him down,"
> "A golden hoop could not trap him,"
> "Trading the death of the flesh for the eternity of the mind."

　　And the other line:

> "When I was practicing the Tao in years past, my Master often said that 'The perfect shut requires no bolt yet cannot be opened; the perfect knot requires no rope yet cannot be untied.' **Since then, I have known** that the only thing binding us is ourselves."

　　Now, let's look at what Erlang actually *did* in the centuries following Wukong's death:

　　1.  He hid inside the painting of Mount Mei but kept tabs on the outside world (likely through allies).
　　2.  He dispatched the Seven Brothers of Mount Mei to ambush and test the Destined One. He might have also coordinated with Maitreya and Yuan Shoucheng to assist the Destined One's resurrection.
　　3.  He handed the Ruyi Scroll to the "Six Ding and Six Jia" deities, which eventually reached the Destined One, giving him a "home" in Zodiac Village.
　　4.  He waited for the Destined One to arrive, picked a fight with him, and then returned the "Mind Root" (Relic of Freed Mind).

　　Every action Erlang takes in the plot revolves around Wukong's resurrection. The problem is that his planning is remarkably simplistic; it shows no deep, strategic "grandmaster" thinking. Furthermore, hiding in Mount Mei severely limited his agency, leaving him isolated within the Three Realms and devoid of political influence.

　　In *Black Myth: Wukong*, character lore is primarily revealed through the "Portraits." Adding more backstory wouldn't interfere with the combat gameplay, yet the current entries are quite sparse. The writers could have used the Portraits to showcase Erlang’s strategic brilliance as a "genius leader," but it seems they lacked the imagination to conceive what such a leader would actually think or do.

　　Many players believe that once Erlang returns the "Freed Mind" to the Destined One, his mission is accomplished and he can just go rest. This view is politically naive. Wukong's resurrection would inevitably trigger a massive political firestorm, and there is no way the Celestial Court wouldn't know that the "Mind Root" was the key. As the commander of the siege on Mount Huaguo, Erlang would be the first person investigated and held accountable. How could he just "walk away"? 

　　In this game’s universe, those who betray the Court or Lingshan are purged (Wukong), and those who offend high-ranking officials are punished (Starry Pleiades). The higher the position, the greater the accountability. Erlang hid the Mind Root and spearheaded the resurrection plan—this is a catastrophic political error. Even as the Jade Emperor's nephew, the Court would likely show no mercy. If the Celestial Court used airplanes for transport, Erlang would probably suffer a very convenient "unfortunate crash."

### Character Role Downgrade

**[Erlang Shen]**

　　The description of Erlang Shen’s functions in *Journey to the West* (JTTW) is somewhat contradictory. As the Jade Emperor's nephew, he was bestowed the title "King of Manifesting Sagehood" (昭惠灵显王). What kind of "King" is this? In folk religion, he is the "Lord of Sichuan," the guardian deity of the Ba-Shu region. His Meishan Brothers hold titles like *Grand Commandant* (太尉) and *General* (将军). While these roles varied across dynasties, they generally represent high-ranking military commanders or senior advisors to the sovereign. Furthermore, Erlang possesses a private army, the "Spirit-headed Soldiers" (草头神). From this perspective, Erlang’s status is akin to a vassal king or a regional warlord—specifically a vassal king, given his title was granted by the Jade Emperor and he maintains a military independent of the Celestial Court. Conversely, he is also depicted as managing mundane affairs, such as reviewing petitions from individual devotees and auditing incense offerings. This contradiction likely arises from the author’s attempt to fit Erlang’s real-world role in folk religion into a mythological framework.

　　Chapter 6 of JTTW describes the functions of the Meishan Brothers:

> The True Lord immediately summoned the six brothers of Meishan—the four Grand Commandants Kang, Zhang, Yao, and Li, and the two Generals Guo Shen and Zhi Jian—to the front of the hall and said: "The Jade Emperor has just dispatched us to Mount Huaguo to subdue the demon monkey. Let us go together." The brothers were all eager to go. They mustered the divine troops of their department, took their hawks and hounds, braced their crossbows and bows, and set off on a wild wind... [Erlang said to them:] "You [Meishan Brothers] lead the host [Spirit-headed Soldiers] to search the mountain here. Once it is cleared, return to Guankou."

　　In *Black Myth: Wukong*, Erlang’s traditional functions are completely ignored. In the plot, he performs no duties as a guardian deity, nor does he display any political ambition. In JTTW, Erlang is interested in achieving military glory and merit; the fact that he could build and manage his own elite armed forces and command widespread public faith suggests he is an ambitious and capable leader. In *Black Myth*, however, his actions revolve solely around the Wukong resurrection plan. The dialogue heavily leans into his deep "affection" for Wukong (Classic Erlang Line 1: *"You monkey, you truly bring me joy!"*; Classic Erlang Line 2: *"Every day you were gone, I thought of you."*). 

　　This hyper-fixation on his feelings for Wukong, coupled with the total lack of strategic or functional description, makes him look like his "brain has been poisoned by the monkey"—loving the monkey more than his own empire. This is fundamentally inconsistent with his setting as a "genius leader" and "vassal king."

</figure>

　　Resurrecting Sun Wukong could be a major motivation, but if he were a "genius," he would have leveraged his power and resources for much deeper, multi-layered planning. He should possess the foresight to realize that resurrecting Wukong is the easy part; the hard part is ensuring Wukong’s long-term freedom and managing the inevitable political fallout. He would need to build sufficient defensive capabilities to withstand the Court’s inevitable purge. A proper preparation for Wukong's return would include:

1.  **Manipulating Public Opinion:** Garnering support among the various Yaos and Immortals so the Court wouldn't dare move against Wukong lightly.
2.  **Seizing the Center of Power:** Positioning himself at the heart of the political structure to gain enough influence to shield Wukong.
3.  **Expanding Military Might:** Increasing his forces to improve his odds against a Celestial invasion.
4.  **Regrouping Mount Huaguo:** Re-establishing Wukong’s base so he has a place to settle after resurrection.
(I could elaborate on these four points, but I’m too tired of this "loveless" writing to continue.)

Furthermore, since the conflict between Immortals and Yaos centers on **Lingyun (Spirit Essence)**, a "genius" Erlang should have started there:
1.  Researching alternative sources of Lingyun to reduce the Celestial/Buddhist extraction from the Yao world.
2.  Gaining control over Lingyun mining rights to fund military expansion and secure greater political leverage.

**[The Meishan Brothers]**

　　As mentioned, the Meishan Brothers hold the ranks of Grand Commandant and General. In JTTW, they serve as commanders of the Spirit-headed Soldiers, which fits their titles. Although these soldiers number only 1,200, they are an elite force; when Erlang attacked Mount Huaguo, these 1,200 easily defeated Wukong’s 48,000 monkey demons. Thus, as commanders of such an elite unit, the Meishan Brothers must possess significant military and strategic capability.

　　In *Black Myth: Wukong*, however, their roles are severely downgraded. They are sent across various maps to ambush, track, and "test" the Destined One—essentially acting as scouts, spies, or intelligence officers. For instance, the dialogue of the White-Clad Noble (the White Snake Guai, Chang Hao) explains his role:

> "Hold! It was my Eldest Brother who asked me to act as an insider here; I only feigned obedience to that Black Bear to guard this mountain pass."

　　(Listen, buddy, your Eldest Brother must be out of his mind to send a Grand Commandant/General to do the work of a spy—and you actually did it? "Insiders" are usually low-level soldiers with no rank. A Grand Commandant is Rank 1, and a General is Rank 3. Having Erlang Shen send high-ranking military officials to do grunt-level espionage work is a complete collapse of his administrative logic by the Game Science writers.)

<figure>
    <img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/blackmyth/曹嵩.webp">
    <figcaption>Cao Song: "I’m the Grand Commandant and Cao Cao’s father. You’re telling me His Majesty wants me to guard a mountain pass?" (Source: Internet)</figcaption>
</figure>

    <figcaption>Gao Qiu: "I’m also a Grand Commandant. What? His Majesty wants me to lie in an ambush in the snow?" (Source: Internet)</figcaption>
</figure>

　　The gap between a **Grand Commandant/General** and a **Scout** is gargantuan—it’s equivalent to the difference between a modern **Secretary of Defense/Lieutenant General** and a **Field Intelligence Agent**. Even if the hierarchy of the "Spirit-headed Soldiers" isn't that complex, demoting the Meishan Brothers from high-ranking military commanders to frontline scouts is beyond absurd. If the Meishan Brothers are doing grunt work, who exactly is leading the army? Furthermore, the "Portrait" entries for the Meishan Brothers read like stories of "small fry" characters, rather than tales of military leaders or senior strategists. 

　　Game Science’s writers effectively dismantled Erlang Shen's formidable military organization (drastically lowering his "aura" or *bīgé* in the process), which is yet another manifestation of the loose political organization in *Black Myth: Wukong*. As a member of the imperial family, Erlang is destined to be a political figure, especially given his status as a highly capable leader (you don't build an elite private army like the Spirit-headed Soldiers without serious administrative chops). Maintaining his "aura" shouldn't just be about buffing his stats and giving him a shield; his words, deeds, decision-making, and governing ability are what truly define his stature.

　　In the original *Journey to the West*, the political organizations described have clear, hierarchical power structures. For instance, Chapter 3, *"The Four Seas and Thousands of Mountains All Submit; the Ten Species of the Underworld are Deleted from the Registers,"* describes the distinct roles and ranks within the Dragon Palace:

> The Dragon King, the Dragon Princes, the Dragon Mother, the Dragon Daughter, Admiral Bream, Generalissimo Carp, General Crab, Soldier Shrimp, and the patrolling Night-watch Yaksha.

　　Even Sun Wukong’s "grassroots" army at Mount Huaguo had clear tiers and functional differences:

> The Monkey King appointed the four senior monkeys as his chief commanders: the two Red-Bottomed Horse-Monkeys were named Marshals Ma and Liu; the two Long-Armed Apes were named Generals Beng and Ba. He entrusted the arrangement of the camp, rewards, punishments, and all other affairs to these four commanders.

　　Here, Sun Wukong is the supreme leader (Handsome Monkey King/Great Sage Equaling Heaven), followed by Marshals Ma and Liu, then Generals Beng and Ba, and finally the Four Commanders. The power structure is a progressive ladder. Different roles perform different tasks; that is the only way an organization functions properly.

　　One has to wonder: was it easier for Wu Cheng'en to research data five hundred years ago, or is it easier for Game Science writers today? It's the 21st century, and yet the depiction of political organization is less rigorous than a Ming Dynasty novel. What else is there to say?

**A detailed diagram of the Tang Dynasty's "Fubing" (Militia) System:**

    <figcaption>A breakdown of the Fubing System, the martial foundation of the Tang Dynasty (Source: Zhuang Shengchen)</figcaption>
</figure>

*(Note: In the Tang Dynasty, the title of "Grand Commandant" (Taiwei) was an honorary position, which is why it does not appear in the military diagram above.)*

　　In short, the depiction of the Meishan Brothers—their dialogue and their Portrait entries—fails to showcase the strategic wisdom or the grand vision expected of high-ranking generals. A more rational plot would have framed them as "part-time testers" for the Destined One. For instance, their primary duties should have involved political infiltration, strategic planning, and troop management; testing the Destined One would be a side task upon his arrival, rather than their entire functional identity being reduced to "guarding a back mountain pass" like common sentries. 

　　Defining the Meishan Brothers as more strategic leaders would only require revising their dialogue and lore to emphasize their military functions. This would not have hindered the gameplay experience of fighting them for XP, but it would have preserved the narrative's integrity.

　　Reducing their primary function to "testing the protagonist"—even to the point of abandoning their original duties—is illogical. It makes Erlang Shen's alliance look weak and intellectually bankrupt. If Erlang’s senior advisors are merely playing the roles of scouts and spies, it stands to reason that his "Spirit-headed Soldiers" lack any real strategic command structure.

　　According to Chapters 5 and 6 of the original 100-chapter *Journey to the West*, the strength of Erlang Shen and his private army is on par with the Celestial host. Such immense power suggests that Erlang’s political influence should be formidable. Seeing his faction’s role downgraded to this level in *Black Myth: Wukong* is truly disheartening.

　　In the original novel, Sun Wukong’s social circle is defined by **elitism and a respect for power**. After being suppressed by the Great Immortal Zhenyuan, Wukong ends up becoming "sworn brothers" with him—a relationship described with almost excessive sentimentality. Wukong also shows a high degree of respect for Erlang Shen. In Chapter 6, even as Erlang hurls insults like "you stable-boy" (Bimawen) or "you beast," Wukong addresses him as "My Lord" (郎君). By Chapter 63, when they are no longer enemies, Wukong’s attitude becomes almost shy; he feels embarrassed to face Erlang and asks Pigsy to invite him, saying he wishes to "pay his respects." When they finally meet, they are literally holding hands. Wukong’s titles for him shift to "Great Sage Brother," "True Lord," and "Elder Brother." 

　　(Considering Erlang once burned down Mount Huaguo, Wukong’s reverence seems a bit much, but it proves a point.) 

　　Wukong would crush a minor demon like the Bone Spirit with one strike without a second thought. As the Great Sage Equaling Heaven and a regional hegemon of Mount Huaguo, his friendship with Erlang isn't just mutual heroic respect—it carries the weight of political recognition between two "Great Powers." This "high-society" taste in friends likely reflects the author Wu Cheng’en’s own life. His wife came from a prestigious family (the great-granddaughter of a Minister of Revenue), and his circle consisted of literary giants like Wen Zhengming and high-ranking officials like the Grand Secretary Li Chunfang. If Wu Cheng’en had written a plot where Sun Wukong falls in love with a lowly Bone Demon, his friends probably would have thought he’d lost his mind.

　　The current portrayal makes the Meishan faction look like it lacks political intelligence and influence. They don't act like regional lords or warlords; they act like a small, independent commando/intel unit. Without their supernatural powers, if their organizational logic and strategic level were transplanted into a Mafia setting in America, they’d be a "rookie family" wiped out by the Corleones in minutes. 

　　Despite both being **INTJ-type** leaders, Erlang Shen is staggeringly deficient in strategy compared to **Michael Corleone**. Michael is a cold, far-sighted leader dedicated to expanding his family’s empire and neutralizing rivals. Erlang, meanwhile, is so fixated on Wukong’s resurrection that his "career" seems to have frozen since Wukong’s death. He hid himself away in a painting while his generals were sent on low-level errands. Under such circumstances, how could his influence possibly grow?

　　While Erlang’s "great sacrifice" for Wukong is moving, he failed to use his political status (Emperor’s nephew, regional lord, Celestial General) and his intelligence network (Meishan Brothers, Yuan Shoucheng, Maitreya) to gain **political leverage** for Wukong. Instead, he fell into a personal, emotional loop of martyrdom. His choices were neither rational nor far-sighted. Most importantly, he made no plans for the political firestorm that Wukong's resurrection would ignite. The stagnation—and even regression—of his own power has made him more vulnerable to the Court’s eventual retribution. If the Celestial Court and Lingshan decide to besiege him now, how will he resist? 

　　Whether he wanted to resurrect Wukong or change the political landscape (the so-called "Destiny"), he should have been aggressively expanding his power. "Lying flat" is not the behavior of a man in his position. You won't find a historical precedent for a genius leader and powerful warlord who sacrifices his entire career and freedom for a friend and then just quits. It’s logically inconsistent. Simply put, Erlang’s behavior does not match his reputation as a "Great Talent of the Heavens."

　　I truly wish that after the Destined One defeats Erlang, his line wasn't:
> "I sent my brothers to test you all this way, just for this moment."

　　But rather:
> "I have maneuvered across the realms and manipulated the heavens to reshape the Three Realms into a place where your heart can finally wander free—it was all for this moment."

　　Seeing Erlang so "distracted" from his proper duties, I felt like jumping into the game to lecture him: *"Brother, to care for a friend without considering the board, and to act without planning for the long term, will only end in regret! A great man should not be trapped by sentiment, but should treat the world as his chessboard, seeking peace for the Three Realms and stability for all living things. Only then can you live up to your name and the grand opportunity before you!"*

　　I strongly recommend that the writers at Game Science, when crafting characters, look to the behavior of similar figures in history or literature. Only then can they create characterizations that are authentic, credible, and consistent with their established personas. The writers clearly haven't committed any murders, divided any spoils, or navigated the treacherous waters of organized crime and officialdom—but have they not even read a history book? *Journey to the West* was written during the Ming Dynasty, an era when accessing information was infinitely more difficult than it is today. It is now the 21st century; if we are going to engage in "cultural export," can we at least hold our writing to a higher standard?

### Shallow Power Struggles

　　Within the world of *Black Myth: Wukong*, the presence of an oppressive centralized government (The Celestial Court) and a formidable religious power (Mount Lingshan) provides a stage perfectly suited for intense Machiavellian maneuvering. However, the game’s depiction of these power struggles is remarkably shallow. The Erlang Shen Alliance is the most fully realized faction, yet as its leader, Erlang Shen displays almost zero political acumen or strategic foresight. He fails to leverage his organization and resources to secure political assets, clear obstacles for Wukong’s resurrection, or guarantee Wukong’s post-resurrection safety (not to mention his own). He lacks a long-term grand design, seemingly content to just "bring Wukong back" without planning for the inevitable political firestorm that would follow. As an independent force opposing the Court, his alliance seeks no expansion of influence—no diplomatic overtures, no subversion, no infiltration via the Meishan Brothers. They simply offer the Destined One some cryptic guidance, making the entire faction feel intellectually stunted and small-scale.

　　If the Celestial Court (the mythological equivalent of the Qin Dynasty in its ruthlessness) and Mount Lingshan (a massive religious apparatus) functioned with the efficiency of their real-world counterparts, Erlang’s plan would never have succeeded. In the game, however, every faction suffers from loose organization and chaotic management. It’s a "battle of the amateurs" (a *Cǎotái Bānzi*), and Erlang’s team only wins because they might be slightly less incompetent than the rest. Wukong’s resurrection isn’t the result of visionary genius or grand strategy; it happens because the opposition is a disorganized mess. This narrative choice is, frankly, embarrassing. Anyone with a modicum of historical or political knowledge will recognize how illogical these plot points are.

　　Furthermore, relationships in the game are almost exclusively personal. Despite all the killing, there is no sense of shifting power structures. For instance, the Yellowbrow killing the Turtle General (a high-ranking subordinate of the Great Tortoise-Snake Deity/True Warrior Emperor) should have been a major political incident. Yet Maitreya, Yellowbrow’s superior, remains unaccountable and unbothered. This lack of consequence suggests a static power structure, which is inconceivable in the real world. (At this point, a classic modern example of a real-world power struggle comes to mind.)

　　To write a convincing divine power struggle, one must first construct a rigorous hierarchy and then simulate how power dynamics shift within it. This is complex; it requires a deep understanding of mythology, history, and politics. If you asked producer Feng Ji to do this, he’d probably fry his CPU before finishing. Currently, the narrative method is simplistic: take scenes and characters from *Journey to the West*, adapt them (mostly by making them as tragic and miserable as possible), and call it a day. This results in characters who are isolated, mechanical, and disconnected from any dynamic power evolution. 

　　Erlang Shen’s position in this structure is particularly warped. The Game Science writers seem to operate on whims rather than logic, ignoring the concept of power structures entirely. Their perspective is heavily biased toward the "small character." They excel at writing the tragic stories of nobodies (like the Mi Daoist), as these are relatable and grounded in common experience. But when they attempt to portray a high-level regional elite and military leader like Erlang Shen, the characterization falls apart. His governing ability is invisible, and his political organization is written as a shambles. Erlang is simply too far removed from the writers' own lives, and their lack of historical reading shows. 

　　Fundamentally, Erlang is a vassal king, while Wukong is a self-made warlord. Is it realistic for a king to sacrifice his entire career and freedom out of "pure devotion" to a warlord friend? It’s absurd. Figures of that caliber rescue allies through political maneuvering and strategic leverage, not by martyring their own personal interests. Even the fan-service idea of Wukong and the Bone Demon falling in love stems from this "small-character" mindset. In the original novel, Wukong’s early associates were powerful demons and immortals, and his social circle only grew more elite over time, favoring high-status, powerful figures like Erlang Shen and Zhenyuanzi. Warlords engage in political marriages; a penniless, powerless mountain demon like the Bone Spirit wouldn't even be on Wukong’s radar.

　　If Game Science could have made these factions more authentic—incorporating high-IQ characters, rigorous organizational logic, and complex intrigue—the story of *Black Myth: Wukong* would have possessed genuine depth.

　　A "Genius" Erlang Shen—one who is both brave and cunning, who meticulously manipulates the Three Realms to clear a path for the freedom of his cherished friend—is far more consistent with his persona (and more "romantic," a word Feng Ji loves) than the "monkey-poisoned," distracted version who spends centuries moping and sacrificing himself for no strategic gain. Wouldn't that have been better?

　　If Petyr Baelish were transported into *Black Myth: Wukong* with a few immortals or yao kings to protect him, I suspect he’d overthrow the Three Realms within fifty years. As he famously said: *"Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder."* This chaotic world would have been his perfect playground.

　　Finally, I suggest that Feng Ji take some anti-aging supplements and nootropics to boost his brainpower, and then properly reshape the characters and plot of his game. If you can’t write a solid script, stop relying on *Wukong Biographies* or *The Diary of Wukong* as references. Instead, I suggest looking into:

**Historical Works:**
* *Zizhi Tongjian* (Comprehensive Mirror in Aid of Governance)
* *Records of the Grand Historian* (Shiji)
* *Records of the Three Kingdoms*, etc.

**Fiction:**
* *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*
* *The Godfather*
* *A Song of Ice and Fire*
* *House of Cards*, etc.

**Postscript:**
　　Aggressively dosing on anti-aging and nootropic supplements has significantly heightened my cognitive faculties. This has allowed me to see the game’s inconsistencies with jarring clarity—whether it’s the botched portrayal of a mastermind’s intellect or the questionable characterization of Lady White Bone; it has all become difficult to look at. Paradoxically, this has robbed me of the simple joy of playing the game. To borrow a line from Emily Dickinson:

> "Had I not seen the Sun
> I could have borne the shade"

　　I suspect Feng Ji intended to frame Erlang Shen as a genius-level puppet master, but his execution fell short of his ambition. If he were to boost his cognitive performance with some nootropics, he would realize just how illogical and underdeveloped his script truly is. However, this might also bring him pain; he would likely find his own flawed narrative unbearable.

　　To describe the effects of my own "cognitive upgrade": even without acquiring new knowledge, I find myself thinking much more deeply about the same subjects. My associative abilities have sharpened—for instance, I realized that Erlang Shen’s strategic level is leagues behind classic characters in similar roles. I already knew of those characters, but the connection didn’t spark until now. Feng Ji surely knows who Zhuge Liang is, but he likely failed to realize how poorly Erlang compares to him because, without a certain level of brainpower, one lacks that specific associative capacity. This capacity directly dictates one's creativity. Furthermore, my prose has become more formal and abstract (a byproduct of tighter logic), I am far more rational (leading to my rejection of Erlang’s behavior), and I am significantly more humorous (as seen in this article—the most wit-heavy piece I’ve ever posted on Zhihu).
