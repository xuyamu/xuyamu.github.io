
　　Yesterday, at the forum titled "Lin Quan: Painting, Calligraphy, and Garden Making," Professor Gao Shiming raised a question: Why is it that, in the end, the world could never find the Peach Blossom Spring again?

　　I have some thoughts of my own regarding this question:

　　Scholars throughout history have discoursed on the specific historical materials The Peach Blossom Spring (Tao Hua Yuan Ji) might have been based on, but that is not the focus of this discussion. Regardless of any realistic allegories The Peach Blossom Spring may contain, there should be no objection to the fact that the story was fictionalized by Tao Yuanming. As the author, aside from drawing inspiration from folklore and legends he had heard or read, what personal intentions might underlie the ending he devised? regarding this, I offer the following conjectures:

1. It is very likely that Tao Yuanming was attempting to express his yearning for an ideal world of reclusion through the telling of the Peach Blossom Spring story. In reality, Tao never found that otherworldly utopia; he remained essentially "within the world." The loss of the Peach Blossom Spring is, therefore, an expression of Tao Yuanming’s own sense of frustration and loss. By venting these feelings, he satisfied his desire to speak and express himself, finding solace in the very satisfaction of that desire.

2. It is possible that Tao Yuanming, subjectively, deeply appreciated and identified with the ending where the location is lost. What is the significance of the Peach Blossom Spring being lost? One crucial significance is that its loss preserves it in a state of mystery. Its disappearance turns it into a legend and an enigma. Legends and enigmas are always attractive and capable of sparking the imagination. If the Peach Blossom Spring were to be developed, revealed, or laid bare, the reality it presented would inevitably lead to disillusionment for those who yearned for it. After all, a tangible Peach Blossom Spring cannot satisfy everyone's fantasy, whereas an illusory one can satisfy everyone's fantasy precisely because it exists only in the imagination.

　　There is a line written by Li Zhuoxiong for the song Red Rose that says, "The unobtainable is forever stirring." This vividly captures the psychological state of desiring something one cannot have. Just as Beatrice stirred the heart of Dante, Utopia stirred Thomas More, and the Garden of Eden stirs Christians, the loss of the Peach Blossom Spring ensures that it remains forever stirring in the hearts of literati who yearn for reclusion, becoming a beautiful, unattainable spiritual anchorage.
