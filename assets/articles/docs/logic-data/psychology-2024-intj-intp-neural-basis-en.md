*(This article is an answer to the Zhihu question "What is the neuroscientific basis for the formation of the INTJ/INTP personality?")*

&emsp;&emsp;When exploring the neuroscientific basis of personality types, we can combine the MBTI with other psychological scales to find more potential neuroscientific foundations for personality formation.

### The Big Five Facets and the MBTI

&emsp;&emsp;First, we need to introduce the Big Five Facets theory. The Big Five Facets are a grouping of five unique characteristics used to study personality. The theory identifies five factors.  Below are the introductions to each factor from Wikipedia:

&emsp;&emsp;**Openness to experience:** Openness to experience is a general appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, unusual ideas, imagination, curiosity, and variety of experience. People who are open to experience are intellectually curious, open to emotion, sensitive to beauty, and willing to try new things. They tend to be, when compared to closed people, more creative and more aware of their feelings.

&emsp;&emsp;**Conscientiousness:** Conscientiousness is a tendency to display self-discipline, act dutifully, and strive for achievement against measures or outside expectations. It is related to the way in which people control, regulate, and direct their impulses. High conscientiousness is often perceived as being stubborn and focused. Low conscientiousness is associated with flexibility and spontaneity, but can also appear as sloppiness and lack of reliability.

&emsp;&emsp;**Extraversion:** Extraversion is characterized by breadth of activities (as opposed to depth), surgency from external activity/situations, and energy creation from external means. The trait is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world. Extraverts enjoy interacting with people, and are often perceived as full of energy. They tend to be enthusiastic and action-oriented.

&emsp;&emsp;**Agreeableness:** Agreeableness is a general concern for social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others. They are generally considerate, kind, generous, trusting, trustworthy, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with others. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human nature.

&emsp;&emsp;**Neuroticism:** Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, or depression. It is sometimes called emotional instability, or reversed and referred to as emotional stability.

&emsp;&emsp;A recent paper titled *The Big Five Facets and the MBTI: The Relationship between the 30 NEO-PI(R) Facets and the Four Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Scores* studied this topic based on a sample of over 9,000 adults. The results showed that the E-I dichotomy has the strongest correlation with Extraversion, with the E dimension of MBTI being positively correlated with Extraversion. The S-N variable indicated that Perceiving (P) types have higher Agreeableness, but lower Openness and Conscientiousness. All five factors are correlated with the T-F dimension, indicating that Conscientiousness is positively correlated with the Thinking dimension, and the other four major facets are negatively correlated with the Thinking dimension.

### The Neural Basis of Extraversion and Openness to Experience

&emsp;&emsp;Numerous studies have revealed the correlation between dopamine function and Extraversion. For instance, the paper *Dopamine genes are linked to Extraversion and Neuroticism personality traits, but only in demanding climates* points out that individuals from populations with highly efficient dopamine systems tend to exhibit behavioral approach traits (Extraversion and emotional stability) due to a higher perception of reward value; whereas individuals from populations with less efficient dopamine systems are more prone to risk avoidance.

&emsp;&emsp;*The neurobiology of openness as a personality trait* summarizes three neural bases for openness to experience:

&emsp;&emsp;The neurobiology of openness appears to be supported by three main functions and their corresponding neural networks: (1) reward processing, involving the dopaminergic system and the ventromedial frontal and limbic reward networks; (2) the ability to recognize others' perspectives and capabilities; and (3) higher-order reasoning and decision-making, mediated by the executive frontoparietal control network (ECN).

### The Neural Basis of Conscientiousness

&emsp;&emsp;Conscientiousness in the Big Five Facets is positively correlated with the J (Judging) in MBTI, and Conscientiousness is generally considered to be positively correlated with dopamine levels. Furthermore, according to *Brain structure links trait conscientiousness to academic performance*, the trait of conscientiousness is positively correlated with the cortical gray matter volume (GMV) of the bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL) and negatively correlated with the GMV of the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG).

### The Neural Basis of Thinking

&emsp;&emsp;British clinical psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen proposed the Empathizing-Systemizing (E-S) theory to study how people think, which categorizes individuals based on their capacities for empathic thinking and systematic thinking.  It uses the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Systemizing Quotient (SQ) to measure a person's abilities. Empathizing is the drive to identify another person's emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion. Systemizing, on the other hand, is the drive to analyze or construct a system—physical environments and objects that can be understood without the use of "emotion," such as mechanical systems, numerical systems, or abstract systems. Systemizing is a drive to find the rules and laws that govern how these systems work, in order to predict and control the system's behavior.

&emsp;&emsp;Descriptively, the Thinking/Feeling dimensions in MBTI seem to be correlated with the Systemizing Quotient/Empathy Quotient. Since there is no direct research on the correlation between the two, we cannot know the exact direct correlation, but a series of data can prove that they are related.

&emsp;&emsp;According to Simon Baron-Cohen's study, *The systemizing quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, and normal sex differences*, women score higher on average in EQ (female average 47, male 38), while men score higher on average in SQ (male 30, female 24). Adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism scored higher on SQ than the control group (male average 36, female 34), and lower on EQ compared to the control group (male 18, female 23).

&emsp;&emsp;The paper *The Empathy and Systemizing Quotient: The Psychometric Properties of the Dutch Version and a Review of the Cross-Cultural Stability* lists the means and standard deviations of SQ and EQ provided in various papers and scales.

&emsp;&emsp;From the charts, we can see that F-type females account for 75.5% of women, F-type males account for 43.4% of men, I-type females account for 47.3% of women, and I-type males account for 54% of men. This set of data shows a significant gender gap in the T/F dimension. This is consistent with the gender tendency phenomenon where women score higher than men in EQ and lower than men in SQ.

&emsp;&emsp;The paper *Regional Gray Matter Volume Is Associated with Empathizing and Systemizing in Young Adults* investigated the correlation of regional gray matter volume (rGMV) with empathizing and systemizing. The study showed that rGMV in the default mode network (DMN) regions correlates with empathizing, whereas rGMV in the external attention system (EAS) regions correlates with systemizing. The DMN regions are active during resting states and generally suspended during externally directed, attention-demanding tasks. The EAS regions, responsible for external attention, respond in the opposite manner during these tasks. Regions such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), precuneus, and superior temporal sulcus (STS) belong to the DMN, while regions like the lateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobule, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), supplementary motor area, and temporoparietal cortex belong to the EAS.

### Autism and INT

&emsp;&emsp;Speaking of Extraversion, we might wonder: who are the most introverted people? Obviously, individuals with autism are among the most introverted. So, is there a relationship between INTJ/INTP and autism?

&emsp;&emsp;Asperger syndrome (AS) is a syndrome within the Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) and falls under the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Its key characteristics are difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, accompanied by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Some descriptions of Asperger syndrome are very similar to descriptions of INTJ/INTP.

&emsp;&emsp;*The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome* was written by Tony Attwood, an Australian clinical child psychiatrist. The author summarizes over 40 years of clinical experience, providing detailed medical and rehabilitation services for individuals with Asperger's. Here is the text's description of the behavior of patients with Asperger syndrome:

> Children with Asperger syndrome may exhibit the following characteristics:
> 1. Delayed development of social reasoning and immature social skills.
> 2. Immature development of empathy.
> 3. Difficulty making friends, often bullied by other children.
> 4. Difficulty in communication and in controlling their own emotions.
> 5. Exceptionally outstanding abilities in certain aspects of language, such as vocabulary and sentence structure, but lacking conversational skills; their tone and pitch might sound like a pedantic old scholar.
> 6. An unusually intense focus on a specific subject matter.
> A lack of understanding of social relationships, a lack of communication skills, and an unusual interest in specific subjects are all typical symptoms of Asperger syndrome. Perhaps, more simply put, their understanding and thoughts about our world are quite different from those of others.
> Children with Asperger syndrome are often ruthlessly honest and always speak their minds bluntly. They are loyal to the truth of facts rather than people's feelings; therefore, they need to learn that they cannot always tell the truth.

&emsp;&emsp;We can see that there is an overlap between the descriptions of Asperger syndrome characteristics and those of INTJ/INTP, especially with INTJ. Here is the description of INTJ from [www.16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com):

> An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.
> INTJs are highly logical and quick-witted, taking pride in their ability to think independently, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. Because their minds are never resting, they can sometimes struggle to find people who can keep up with their non-stop analysis of everything around them. But when they do find like-minded people who appreciate the intensity and depth of their minds, INTJs can form profound, intellectually stimulating relationships that they deeply cherish.
> INTJs aren't exactly known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries—in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. Because they value truth and depth, many common social practices—from small talk to white lies—may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or offensive when they're only trying to be honest.

&emsp;&emsp;Wrong Planet, a communication forum for high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome, hosted a poll. Link:

[Your MBTI (Meyer Briggs) Type (Poll)](https://wrongplanet.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=137942)

&emsp;&emsp;The results show that among the autistic patients who participated in the poll, INTJs accounted for 35%, and INTPs for 24%. According to data provided by the Myers Briggs Company, the proportion of INTJs in the general population is 2.1%, and INTPs is 3.3%. (Note: The forum sample itself has a certain degree of selectivity and requires a certain IQ threshold—at the very least, one must possess enough search ability to find this forum and successfully complete the test. Therefore, this sample cannot reflect the exact personality type ratio of everyone diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome, but it at least reflects that a large number of people with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome test as specific MBTI types.)

&emsp;&emsp;As discussed earlier, there seems to be a certain correlation between Thinking/Feeling in MBTI and the Systemizing/Empathy Quotient, and surveys of personality types among populations with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome also prove this point.

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the above, high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome seem to have a significant correlation with INTJ/INTP. What is the neural basis behind this?

&emsp;&emsp;A possible neural basis is that differences in the area and volume of the cerebral cortex create personality differences. A series of genes have been discovered that simultaneously affect intelligence and autistic traits. One famous example is the NBPF gene.

&emsp;&emsp;In the evolutionary history of the human brain, there is a genetic sequence that influenced brain volume. This sequence encodes the DUF1220 protein domain (also known as Olduvai; the name comes from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa, the source of major anthropological discoveries in the early to mid-1900s).  This sequence forms the core of the NBPF gene. An increase in the copy number (dosage) of DUF1220 is a major contributor to the evolutionary increase in brain size, neuron number, and cognitive abilities associated with primates.

![DUF1220](assets/articles/images/logic-data/DUF1220-3-Figure1-1.png）

&emsp;&emsp;Homo sapiens have up to 270 copies of DUF1220, whereas Neanderthals could reach up to 350 copies. Neanderthals are the mammals with the highest number of DUF1220 gene copies.

&emsp;&emsp;The paper *Human Lineage–Specific Amplification, Selection, and Neuronal Expression of DUF1220 Domains*, published in *Science*, is an early and influential study of DUF1220. The paper points out: DUF1220 domains are highly expressed in brain regions associated with higher cognitive function and preferentially show neuron-specific expression in cell bodies and dendrites in the brain.

&emsp;&emsp;How does DUF1220 copy number affect intelligence? The paper *DUF1220 copy number is linearly associated with increased cognitive function as measured by total IQ and mathematical aptitude scores* examined the association between DUF1220 subtypes CON1 and CON2 and cognitive abilities. For every additional copy of CON2, the WISC IQ increased by 3.3 points. The study showed that an increase in CON2 copy number corresponds to an increase in WISC IQ in North American males, and an increase in CON2 copy number correlates with an increase in mathematical aptitude in New Zealanders.

&emsp;&emsp;The paper *DUF1220-Domain Copy Number Implicated in Human Brain-Size Pathology and Evolution* points out that DUF1220 copy number is correlated with brain gray matter volume.

&emsp;&emsp;The study *Phylogenetic Analysis Supports a Link between DUF1220 Domain Number and Primate Brain Expansion* found that DUF1220 is positively correlated with neocortical volume but not with cerebellar volume.

&emsp;&emsp;The study *DUF1220 copy number is associated with schizophrenia risk and severity: implications for understanding autism and schizophrenia as related diseases* mentions: an increase in CON1 copy number has previously been implicated with an increase in total gray matter volume, with the most significant associations relating to frontal lobe surface area and volume, temporal lobe volume and thickness, and parietal lobe thickness.

&emsp;&emsp;According to *DUF1220 Dosage Is Linearly Associated with Increasing Severity of the Three Primary Symptoms of Autism*, in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, the copy number of CON1 is also linearly associated with the severity of the three primary ASD symptoms in a dose-response manner: social deficits (p = 0.021), communicative impairments (p = 0.030), and repetitive behaviors (p = 0.047). On average, for every additional CON1 copy, the social diagnostic score increases by 0.25 points (SE 0.11 p = 0.021), the communication diagnostic score increases by 0.18 points (SE 0.08 p = 0.030), and the repetitive behavior diagnostic score increases by 0.10 points (SE = 0.05 p = 0.047).

![INTJINTP02](assets/articles/images/logic-data/INTJINTP02.webp）

&emsp;&emsp;In the NBPF sequence, every CON2 is strictly paired with one to three CON1s. This means that if you want to increase your IQ by adding CON2, you have to endure the risk of autism brought on by the increase in CON1.

&emsp;&emsp;In summary, an increase in DUF1220 copy number increases brain volume while also increasing autism tendencies. Neanderthal brain volume is generally considered to have been larger than that of contemporary Homo sapiens. Among the mainstream theories regarding Neanderthals, one theory posits that their poor social skills led to their inability to compete against united Homo sapiens. Research has found that 95% of the raw materials for Neanderthal stone tools were sourced locally, meaning they were typically confined to a certain area, which is the exact opposite of the highly social, migratory Homo sapiens. This seems to indicate that Neanderthals indeed possessed more autistic traits. The sparse population of Neanderthals might also be related to their introverted personality. Even if Neanderthals had a higher average intelligence than Homo sapiens, their sparse population and more introverted nature clearly put them at a disadvantage in conflicts with Homo sapiens. Theories regarding Neanderthal extinction should consider the impact of autism on the survival of the Neanderthal population.

&emsp;&emsp;In past research, there is ample evidence indicating a positive correlation between Full Scale IQ (FSIQ) and measures of brain gray matter. According to *Relationships between IQ and regional cortical gray matter thickness in healthy adults*, higher intelligence in healthy adults is associated with greater intracranial gray matter, with less relationship to white matter. Variations in the thickness of the prefrontal and posterior temporal cortices are particularly linked to intelligence.

&emsp;&emsp;Considering that DUF1220 only increases neocortical volume and not cerebellar volume, this implies that the copy number of DUF1220 affects the ratio of the volume of the cerebrum to the cerebellum (a high copy number of DUF1220 promotes the expansion of the cerebral cortex, while cerebellar expansion does not keep pace. Could this not have some adverse effects?). The paper *Cerebro-cerebellar circuits in autism spectrum disorder* points out: the cerebellum forms multiple closed-loop circuits with regions of the cerebral cortex, supporting motor, language, and social processing. Through these circuits, cerebellar dysfunction may impact core symptoms of ASD such as social and communicative deficits, as well as repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Recent studies support the view that the integrity of cerebro-cerebellar circuits may be important for early cortical development. The disruption of specific cerebro-cerebellar circuits in ASD might hinder the specialization of cortical regions involved in motor control, language, and social interaction, leading to impairments in these domains. Consistent with this concept, structural and functional differences in cerebellar sensorimotor regions and sensorimotor cerebro-cerebellar circuits have been linked to deficits in motor control and an increase in repetitive and stereotyped behaviors in individuals with ASD.

&emsp;&emsp;Among patients with Asperger syndrome, delayed motor development and motor clumsiness are common phenomena, which suggests that their cerebellar function might be problematic. In addition, patients with Asperger syndrome frequently suffer from ADHD. Here are a few related studies:

&emsp;&emsp;**Study 1:**
&emsp;&emsp;*Asperger Syndrome: a frequent comorbidity in first diagnosed adult ADHD patients?* This study investigated 53 adult ADHD patients visiting the authors' outpatient clinic for their first ADHD diagnosis, and tested the efficacy of Baron-Cohen's two screening tools, the "Autism-Spectrum Quotient" (AQ) and "Empathy Quotient" (EQ), in screening for Asperger syndrome in adult ADHD. The results showed: 8 ADHD patients were diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (15.1%). An analysis of the differences in AQ and EQ scores between pure ADHD patients and patients with comorbidities showed that comorbidity patients had significantly higher AQ scores and significantly lower EQ scores. The results indicate that the incidence of Asperger syndrome in adult ADHD appears to be substantially increased (compared to a prevalence of 0.06% in the general population), suggesting that researchers of adult ADHD should also pay attention to autism spectrum disorders.

**&emsp;&emsp;Study 2:**
&emsp;&emsp;*The Co-Occurrence of Autism and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children – What Do We Know?* This review cites a large body of research on the comorbidity of autism and ADHD. The content is extensive, and those interested can look it up themselves.

&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, ADHD patients generally also have issues with cerebellar underdevelopment. Because there are many causes for autism and ADHD, there is currently no research specifically targeting high-IQ groups who simultaneously have both ADHD and autism. We are currently not very clear on why DUF1220 is related to autistic traits. Considering the impact of DUF1220 copy number on autism symptoms, it is highly worth investigating whether an increase in DUF1220 copy number affects the development of cerebro-cerebellar circuits and whether it is also related to ADHD symptoms. The role of DUF1220 copy number is to promote neural stem cell proliferation, thereby increasing cortical gray matter volume. Does it specifically act only on certain brain regions positively correlated with systemizing? If so, its regulation is exceptionally precise; if not, one should consider whether it affects the development of cerebro-cerebellar circuits.

&emsp;&emsp;Discussions relating MBTI to intelligence can be found in: [Which personality types rank in the top five for IQ among the 16 MBTI types?](https://www.zhihu.com/question/557130818/answer/2708484497) 
According to the data provided in that answer, INTJ/INTP personalities indeed have a potential advantage in intelligence. Additionally, in the answer [Which personality types rank in the top five for IQ among the 16 MBTI types?](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.zhihu.com/question/557130818/answer/3504348769), I cited a foreign netizen's survey of MBTI types among students at several top universities. The survey results show that INTJs have the highest proportion in the samples from top universities.

&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, here is the MBTI type distribution data for members of the Sheng Han Society (a high-IQ society in China) circulating on the internet:

![INTJINTP03](assets/articles/images/logic-data/INTJINTP03.jpg）
![INTJINTP04](assets/articles/images/logic-data/INTJINTP04.jpg）

&emsp;&emsp;According to web snapshots, this data likely originates from Chen Wenjin's Weibo:
![INTJINTP05](assets/articles/images/logic-data/INTJINTP05.jpg）
Chen Wenjin is the founder of Sheng Han; thus, the data he provides has a relatively high degree of credibility (it is highly likely to be the actual test results of real Sheng Han members).

&emsp;&emsp;In summary, we can reasonably hypothesize: the higher a person's IQ, the more likely they are to carry risk genes for high-IQ autism, making them more susceptible to autism, and the more likely they are to test as INTJ or INTP on the MBTI test.

Below is a list of historical and contemporary genius figures who have been diagnosed with, or widely considered (by experts and the autistic community) to possess autistic traits, and who are widely believed by netizens to be INTJ/INTP (based on personality-database voting):

&emsp;&emsp;**Isaac Newton:**  Newton was withdrawn and bad-tempered from a young age. In adulthood, he became famous for his fierce competitiveness with peers (like Hooke and Leibniz). He had romantic experiences but never married, dying a virgin. Some of Newton's anecdotes indicate he had issues with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Newton was bad-tempered and impulsive, typical ADHD symptoms. A classic example of Newton spacing out was when he once threw a pocket watch into a boiling pot, mistaking it for an egg.

&emsp;&emsp;*Note: Rumors online claim Newton's family was poor. I carefully checked English sources and found this to be false. Newton's father belonged to the Yeoman class (similar to a wealthy farmer); the family had a manor, agricultural land, and hired laborers. His mother, Hannah Ayscough, was born into a wealthy gentry family. Newton's father died early, and his mother then remarried a wealthy clergyman. Newton's uncle, Reverend William Ayscough, graduated from Cambridge University. Newton went to school from a young age and his studies were never hindered by financial issues, showing his family's conditions were actually quite good.*

&emsp;&emsp;**Nikola Tesla:** This world-renowned genius inventor is also among the geniuses highly suspected of having autism. Tesla was a solitary and eccentric man with many quirks. Despite being pursued by many women due to his tall, elegant, and handsome appearance and outstanding talent, he renounced married life out of rationality and practiced asceticism (dying a virgin). However, Tesla was a very emotionally rich person. He loved pigeons very much; the lonely man once deeply loved a specific pigeon, and when that pigeon died, he exhibited immense grief. Tesla was also a very kind person. He wanted his inventions to be used by all of humanity; to this end, he directly gave up the patent rights to alternating current and made the patent permanently public (which caused massive damage to his personal interests). Later on, he remained dedicated to making free electricity resources available to all of humanity.

&emsp;&emsp;**Albert Einstein:** Einstein was a late talker. He started speaking around age two or three and obsessively repeated sentences until age seven, a classic trait of autism. Einstein's psychological description of himself also heavily resembles the psychology of an autistic individual: "My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a ‘lone traveler’ and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude..."

&emsp;&emsp;**Elon Musk:** The world's richest man and famous entrepreneur claims to have Asperger syndrome and dissociative identity disorder (considering Musk's volatile temper, perhaps he also has ADHD). As a child, Musk was withdrawn, obsessed with reading, socially awkward, and deeply suffered from the negative impacts of school bullying. He is famous for his frequent and outspoken remarks on X (formerly Twitter). (Musk is bad-tempered and loves to speak out, indicating his monoamine levels are probably quite high; his mother's side of the family enjoys high-risk activities, while his father has low emotional intelligence and a bad temper, and might also be an Asperger's patient.)

&emsp;&emsp;The higher a person's IQ, the more likely they are to carry genes that simultaneously raise IQ and autism risk. This can explain why there are so many geniuses in history with significant autism symptoms.
### Empathy in INTJ/INTP

&emsp;&emsp;Based on our observations of INTJ/INTPs in online communities and historical figures believed to be INTJ/INTP, we find that some INTJ/INTPs are socially responsible, empathetic, have good relationships with family and friends, and are emotionally rich (e.g., Tesla, Einstein). But some are arrogant, selfish, and have EQ so low they have no friends (e.g., Newton). Why is this? This might be because being empathetic and emotionally rich is caused by a completely different neural mechanism than the one that forms the INT personality type. Here, we propose a candidate gene: the OXTR gene (Oxytocin receptor gene). Oxytocin is generally considered to be related to empathy. OXTR rs53576 is a widely studied OXTR gene polymorphism; the G allele reduces the methylation of OXTR, thereby increasing the expression of OXTR. This gene has been found to be associated with empathy in extensive research. For example, the study *Oxytocin receptor genetic variation relates to empathy and stress reactivity in humans* found that compared to individuals homozygous for the G allele of rs53576 (GG), individuals with one or two copies of the A allele (AG/AA) exhibit lower behavioral and dispositional empathy. The study *Associations between spouses' oxytocin receptor gene polymorphism, attachment security, and marital satisfaction* showed that individuals with the "GG" genotype of rs53576 are more likely to feel closer to their partners and feel more secure in their relationships. In addition, oxytocin is also related to dopamine function. The oxytocinergic circuits projecting from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus innervate dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), projecting to the nucleus accumbens, forming the mesolimbic pathway. Oxytocin activates the PVN→VTA projection, influencing sexual behavior, social behavior, and addictive behavior through its connection with the mesolimbic pathway. The paper *Oxytocin Influences Male Sexual Activity via Non-synaptic Axonal Release in the Spinal Cord* found that: Oxytocin directly activates SEG/GRP neurons via the oxytocin receptor, which detects oxytocin and influences male sexual function in the lumbar spinal cord of rats. The use of an oxytocin receptor antagonist reduced oxytocin receptor activity, leading to an increase in latency and a decrease in the number of sexual activities and ejaculatory responses in most experimental animals, confirming the importance of oxytocin.

### Methods to Change Personality

&emsp;&emsp;It is very difficult to change brain structure, but we can alter personality by changing neuronal function and neurotransmitter levels. Here are some potential methods to change personality:

&emsp;&emsp;**Raising dopamine levels:** It is known that dopamine has a positive correlation with Openness to experience, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness. Thus, increasing dopamine levels might help a person become more extraverted, open-minded, and conscientious. MAOIs (Monoamine oxidase inhibitors) are common small-molecule compounds that increase dopamine. Among them, the MAOI Selegiline has been proven in experiments to extend the lifespan of mammals, while Tranylcypromine, as a dual inhibitor of MAOI and LSD1, is a core component of cellular reprogramming and has been proven in experiments to extend the lifespan of non-vertebrates (there are no mammalian experiments yet; there are related nematode experiments abroad, and my research group has done life-extension experiments on fruit flies). INTP friends who want to become INTJs can try this route.

&emsp;&emsp;**Improving neuronal efficiency:** Although we cannot use small-molecule compounds to regulate neurons in a specific area, we can use small-molecule compounds to increase the overall activity level of neurons. A representative among nootropic small molecules is Piracetam. Piracetam can promote the conversion of ADP to ATP in the brain, improving the brain's metabolic energy supply status.

&emsp;&emsp;**Increasing empathy:** Oxytocin function is known to be related to empathy. Clinical trials have found that low-frequency oxytocin nasal sprays can improve autism symptoms in children. Friends who need to increase their own or their loved ones' empathy can try this method.

### INTJ/INTP and Mood Disorders

&emsp;&emsp;Through observing INTJ/INTPs in online communities, I found that many INTJ/INTP friends have mood disorder issues. Particularly with INTJs, many self-report having mood disorder problems. I used to have mood disorder issues too (anxiety, depression, etc.), and later I discovered that my mood disorders were caused by neuroinflammation. It is known that the high-functioning ASD population frequently reports the occurrence of depression, at a rate of about 25%~34%. Compared to the 5% of adults in the general population suffering from depression, this rate is staggeringly high. It is known that the NBPF gene is a target gene of NF-κB. This means that if a person has high NF-κB expression, it will increase their NBPF gene expression, making them more likely to develop autism. Meanwhile, the activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB or MAPK signaling mediating neuroinflammation leads to depression-like behaviors. This explains why autistic patients are more susceptible to mood disorders. Research shows that autistic patients with high IQs have more suicidal thoughts than the control group (relevant info: 
https://medicine.uiowa.edu/content/autism-combined-high-iq-increases-risk-suicidal-thoughtshis phenomenon might be related to the fact that people with high levels of NF-κB are more likely to develop autism through high expression of NBPF.

**Appendix:**

 &emsp;&emsp;**On the meaning of MBTI:** Many friends think the MBTI personality scale is not rigorous and therefore meaningless. Although the MBTI personality scale is not as rigorous as scales like the Big Five Facets, it is not without neuroscientific basis and is absolutely not comparable to things like horoscopes. The MBTI is widely applied and has a large amount of data, so it can be used as corroborative evidence to discover some patterns, which can then be subjected to more rigorous scientific research—this makes it very meaningful. For example, if we discover significant MBTI type proportions in specific populations (high-functioning autistic patients, students of top universities), is there a pattern behind this? This is what we need to think about. We should not dismiss these significant phenomena; instead, we should think deeply to discover the underlying laws.

 &emsp;&emsp;Another very important meaning of MBTI is its social function. You can understand your personality type through the test and then find your peers online. If you have autism and a high IQ, and you only take an autism test, you'll find you have autism. Then you join autism social circles, only to find that most autistic patients have low or average IQs, and you share no common language with them. If you then take an MBTI test and find you are an INTJ or INTP, you can find more of your kind (people who have autism and are also INTJ/INTP) in MBTI social circles to make friends. This is of immense significance for high-IQ autistic patients who find it very difficult to make friends.

 &emsp;&emsp;Most autistic patients with exceptional IQs have not been diagnosed. According to the paper *Autism in gifted youth is associated with low processing speed and high verbal ability*:

> Autistic individuals with an IQ >= 120 are almost 15 times more likely to go undiagnosed until adulthood than those with lower IQs (IQ < 70).
> Our results indicate that autistic individuals with exceptional abilities do not receive the treatment they deserve, and they suffer from high anxiety and low self-esteem.

 &emsp;&emsp;This phenomenon is very easy to understand. People with high IQs are relatively more likely to succeed in academics and careers. If high-IQ autistic individuals live smoothly, they generally won't go to the hospital for a diagnosis (unless they are particularly interested in the topic), which leads to a low diagnosis rate for high-IQ autistic patients. In China, where there is a massive gap in psychological diagnostics, this situation is especially severe. When reviewing literature, I found that there is far more English literature on high-IQ autism research than Chinese literature, and there are far more English social media posts discussing high-IQ autism than Chinese ones. Furthermore, based on my observations, there are very few high-IQ autistic patients in autism communication communities (such as the Baidu Autism Tieba, Asperger Syndrome Tieba); conversely, academic and tech communication communities are filled with massive numbers of high-IQ autistic individuals. In Chinese culture, academic performance is immensely important. Usually, as long as a child has good grades and their behavior is not so outrageously abnormal as to severely affect other students, it is highly unlikely they will be sent to a psychiatric hospital for diagnosis.

 &emsp;&emsp;The paper *Autism Spectrum Disorder and IQ – A Complex Interplay* provides a chart of IQ distribution among autistic patients:

> Upper part: IQ level distribution of the sample described in Wolff et al. (2022) as well as of a typical normative sample. The y-axis shows percentages, and the x-axis shows IQ values, aggregated by IQ levels 7 – 1 (from left to right) according to the multiaxial system (20, 21). Lower part: N = number of included individuals per ADOS module and sub-cohort, a = mean age (in years) of included individuals. The IQ level distribution shows the classification according to the psychiatric multiaxial schema (20, 21). In this schema, individuals can be categorized on axis 3 "intelligence level" according to the following classification: IQ Level 1 = IQ > 129, IQ Level 2 = IQ = 115 – 129, IQ Level 3 = IQ = 85 – 114, IQ Level 4 = IQ = 70 – 84, IQ Level 5 = IQ = 50 – 69, IQ Level 6 = IQ = 25 – 49, IQ Level 7 = IQ = 20 – 34, IQ Level 8 (not shown here as we had no participants labeled with IQ level 8) = IQ < 20. We also present the IQ level distribution in a normative sample.

 &emsp;&emsp;As shown in the figure, the IQ distribution of autistic patients differs significantly from that of non-autistic patients. Autistic patients are more likely to have either low or high IQs. Considering that a large number of high-IQ autistic patients have not sought medical attention (the consultation rate is far lower than that of low-IQ autistic patients), the proportion of high-IQ autistic patients is likely even higher in reality. This IQ distribution might be due to different autism-causing genes. If the autism in a portion of autistic patients is caused by autism genes that lower intelligence, while the autism in another portion is caused by high-IQ genes, then the IQ distribution would present this bimodal shape. This bimodal distribution aligns with current research on autism-causing genes.

 &emsp;&emsp;We discussed earlier that DUF1220 copy number increases IQ while increasing autism risk. So, if an autistic patient's autism symptoms are caused by a very high DUF1220 copy number, they are highly likely to have a high IQ. A series of genes have been discovered that cause autism symptoms while simultaneously lowering intelligence, such as the SYNGAP1 gene. This gene encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein, which is a member of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex. Its pathogenic variants are associated with a variety of clinical manifestations. About half of children carrying SYNGAP1 gene variants have autism-like manifestations, and most patients are also accompanied by intellectual disability, developmental delay, and epilepsy.

 &emsp;&emsp;The study *A Third Linear Association Between Olduvai (DUF1220) Copy Number and Severity of the Classic Symptoms of Inherited Autism* shows:

> In multiplex families, the copy number of Olduvai subtype CON1 is linearly associated with the severity of the primary symptoms of autism.

 &emsp;&emsp;That is to say, autism symptoms triggered by DUF1220 copy number have significant familial heritability, so the families of high-IQ autistic patients often have other high-IQ autistic individuals. My family is like this. I discussed this issue with other high-IQ autistic friends and found that this situation also exists in many of their families. Fellow high-IQ autistic friends can grab their high-IQ relatives to do an adult autism scale to see if they score high. (•̀ᴗ•́) ̑̑

 &emsp;&emsp;**Newly added thoughts in August 2025:**

 &emsp;&emsp;The more neurons there are, the more information is encoded, and the greater the amount of text/information, on the one hand, it will look more devoid of personal color, and on the other hand, it will be more comprehensively considered. The overall impression given is that it is more rational. Making judgments based on information is generally considered a rational way of thinking; making judgments based on instinct or emotion is considered irrational. The higher the DUF1220 copy number, the more neurons there are, and the more information is encoded, allowing people to make relatively rational judgments based on more information, thus making them more inclined toward the T dimension. Furthermore, I found that taking nootropics (such as Noopept + Citicoline, a combination that can improve the efficiency of the acetylcholine system) makes people smarter (manifested as being able to think more and having enhanced systemizing abilities) and increases the T dimension (tending to be blunter and more unsparing when commenting on things). Mechanistically, Noopept + Citicoline may increase prefrontal cortex function. In addition, the prefrontal cortex has an impulse inhibition function. As we mentioned earlier, the increase in CON1 copy number is associated with the surface area of the frontal lobe. That is to say, the higher the DUF1220 copy number (CON1), the more developed the frontal lobe, and the stronger the impulse inhibition function. This can also provide a basis for the relationship between DUF1220 copy number and the formation of the INT personality type.
