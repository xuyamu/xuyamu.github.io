**I. Overview**

Many sages in history have expressed their views on the consolation of art. For instance, Schopenhauer regarded art as one of the three ways to escape the emptiness of life (the other two being asceticism and suicide), while Nietzsche believed that only the consolation of art could save humanity walking in the void. Furthermore, countless art practitioners in history have found the meaning of life in art, gaining solace during the creative process—such as Ingres, who was obsessed with classical beauty and created countless beautiful paintings, and Van Gogh, who never regretted his unique artistic philosophy even though it left him destitute and misunderstood.

Before discussing the consolation of art, to facilitate understanding and discussion, the author will first define the meaning of "art" as used in this text: it includes artworks, artistic concepts, artistic pursuits, and other related matters. It can be a tangible entity or an ideology.

The recipients of artistic consolation can be divided into four categories: art creators, art appreciators, art managers (dealers), and art collectors. These types of recipients share similarities and differences in how they obtain solace through art. A single person can possess multiple identities simultaneously; for instance, a painter can create paintings, appreciate works, open a gallery, and collect or sell artworks.

**II. Pathways to Artistic Consolation**

1\. The Aesthetic Pathway

The aesthetic value of art has long been widely recognized and studied. The sense of beauty generated when appreciating art is an important driving force prompting people to create and appreciate art. What exactly is the "sense of beauty"? Aestheticians in history have held different views; for example, Li Zehou (李泽厚) divided the sense of beauty into three levels: "pleasing to the ear and eye, pleasing to the heart and mind, and pleasing to the spirit and will." To facilitate discussion, the author defines the sense of beauty as "a positive, pleasing emotion generated by receiving the form, color, taste, and other characteristics of an artwork through the senses during the process of appreciating beautiful things."

As for the answer to the question "what is a beautiful thing", it varies from person to person. The formation of these views is based on the interaction between innate nature and the postnatal environment. Aesthetic nature, as a psychology formed during long-term human evolution, is closely related to human survival and reproduction. For example, the appreciation of human body symmetry is universal: symmetry is a sign of health, and the accurate selection of healthy individuals during mate selection helps an individual propagate their genes. Another typical example is the appreciation of young women: people tend to consider young women with smooth skin, balanced posture, and regular features as beautiful because such women are generally healthier and have better reproductive capacity. The postnatal environment also influences human aesthetic taste. Here are two typical examples: the appreciation of plump figures during the High Tang Dynasty and the aesthetic of small feet among Han people for a long period in ancient China. In today's society, these two tendencies hardly exist, especially the latter, which is viewed by the vast majority of contemporary Chinese as deformed and insulting to women. As for which factor, innate factors or the postnatal environment, has a greater influence on a person's aesthetic view, it depends on which side has the more dominant influence. Taking the aforementioned aesthetic of small feet as an example: when the appreciation and fondling of "three-inch golden lotus" (bound feet) became a dominant cultural ideology and social fashion, this taste overcame the appreciation for a healthy body and bodily integrity that should have existed in the human subconscious. However, in an environment that relatively values human rights and the liberation of human nature, this deformed aesthetic naturally vanished. Admittedly, humans do not consciously reflect on the causes of their aesthetic tendencies during aesthetic activities, yet the subconscious already holds certain tendencies constrained by innate biological factors and the postnatal cultural environment.

In summary, for different individuals, the things that trigger a sense of beauty are different. In the process of appreciating artworks, the appreciator may generate a sense of beauty and thereby receive consolation. To avoid confusion between the associative pathway (to be mentioned later) and the aesthetic pathway mentioned above, the author defines the "aesthetic pathway" in this text as "solace obtained through the pleasurable emotions generated by the direct and positive feelings brought to the senses by the artwork." For example, the rhythm of music pleases the ear, and the colors of lines please the eye. When appreciating the rhythm of music or the colors of lines, the appreciator can obtain pleasure directly without making any associations (referring here to conscious association, rather than subconscious behavior).

2\. The Associative Pathway

When appreciating artworks, people make associations during the process of viewing or listening. As Gauguin said: "In painting, all sensations are condensed; everyone can weave a story according to their own imagination when appreciating it—and with just a glance—can let their soul immerse in the most distant memories; without needing to rack one's brains, everything is covered in an instant." \*

In this kind of association, the appreciator can also find solace. For example, when listening to music, one might associate it with various images, such as a peaceful landscape, and these images can give comfort. The difference between the associative pathway and the aesthetic pathway is that in the associative pathway, the art appreciator does not merely let the senses accept the stimulation of the artwork but associates other things related to the artwork in the brain, thereby generating positive emotions and gaining solace. In the associative pathway, imagination and a certain degree of rational thinking are necessary.

In the following text, the author will list some types of associated images and positive emotions.

(1) Beautiful things and the sense of beauty. Although the author distinguished between the aesthetic and associative pathways above, the close relationship between them must be clarified here: art appreciators may also experience a sense of beauty during the process of association. For example, a listener might think of a peaceful and beautiful landscape when hearing soft music, and this imagined landscape brings them a sense of beauty, through which they obtain solace.

(2) Touching things and the feeling of being moved. Some artworks remind people of touching things, allowing the appreciator to experience the emotion of being moved and gain solace from it. For instance, a portrait of Lei Feng (雷锋) might trigger associations in an appreciator regarding Lei Feng's deeds of helping others and his spirit, leading to the positive emotion of being moved and thus obtaining solace.

(3) Inspirational things and inspirational emotions. Some artworks remind people of inspiring things. For example, when listening to Beethoven's Symphony of Destiny (Symphony No.5), the listener might associate the rousing melody with victory. This association stimulates the listener's fighting spirit and confidence, through which they gain solace. Ancient war drums and Beethoven's Symphony of Destiny work in similar ways: both have the effect of inspiring and soothing the heart. The difference is that the audience of the former consists of soldiers suffering from war or feeling dejected, while the latter consists of classical music lovers sitting in concert halls or before music players.

(4) Things that trigger resonance and the feeling of resonance. In the process of appreciating and interpreting artworks, appreciators may associate things that resonate with them. For example, Hölderlin once resonated with Heidegger, which led Heidegger to greatly admire Hölderlin's poetry and expound upon it multiple times. Admittedly, so-called resonance is sometimes merely the wishful thinking of the art appreciator, because the appreciator may not understand the creator's true intent or may even misread it. Such misreading is basically unavoidable because the appreciator can never possess the same brain circuits as the creator and thus will inevitably not generate the exact same thoughts. Moreover, a correct judgment on whether it is a misreading is impossible, because a human individual cannot confirm the true intent of another being that seemingly possesses understanding, just as in John Searle's "Chinese Room" thought experiment, humans cannot confirm whether a computer passing the Turing test truly understands Chinese. While humans cannot make absolutely correct judgments about others' thoughts, they can still judge whether another understands something based on various communication rules. For example, an artist can view the applause of the audience as understanding and praise for their work. Besides, misreading is not a bad thing. As is commonly held in the postmodernist view of text, this potential "beautiful misunderstanding" provides the appreciator with the possibility of re-creation, and the work gains new life through constant misreading and re-interpretation.

(5) Things that trigger hope and the feeling of being hopeful. During the process of appreciating and interpreting artworks, appreciators may associate things that trigger hope and derive solace from them. For example, a destitute Christian believer, upon seeing a statue of the Virgin Mary, might associate it with the hope of going to heaven after death by virtue of their piety to live a happy and joyful life, thus becoming filled with hope.

3\. The Pathway of Belief

Art can serve as a belief, becoming a lifelong pursuit and providing the motivation for survival. For example, for an art worker engaged in artistic practice, artistic creation can become their pursuit. Paul Gauguin, a pioneer of modern art, held firm to unique artistic concepts and poured countless efforts into them. For someone dedicated to creating artistic concepts, exploring the essence of art can become their pursuit. For example, the German art theorist Rudolf Arnheim dedicated himself to unraveling the various mysteries related to art and wrote many classic books on art theory.

Generally, when speaking of belief, people first think of religious faith. However, apart from religions, other things can also become a person's belief. For example, some scientists regard science as their faith and take exploring the essence of the world as their life's duty; similarly, a doctor might regard healing the sick and saving lives as their life's faith and dedicate their whole life to it. From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, humans need beliefs because faith promotes human health. As the saying goes, "nine out of ten things in life go against one's wishes". If a person lacks beliefs to support their survival, it is easy to lose hope and direction when encountering difficulties in life, and this bewildered mental state is obviously detrimental to health. Therefore, humans have evolved biological mechanisms related to belief. A major characteristic of belief is that it provides spiritual reliance; thus, things that can become beliefs often possess characteristics such as consoling the heart and supporting a person's philosophy of life. Art, with its rich connotations, certainly meets these requirements. Admittedly, compared to artistic belief, religious faith, because it often involves the worship of a supernatural, omnipotent Creator, can provide greater comfort. However, religious faith also has its points of failure. For example, there are many atheists in the world who lack interest in adopting religious faith. The pessimistic philosopher Schopenhauer, who held atheist views, discarded religious faith, a perfectly qualified path, when proposing three major ways to resolve the suffering of life, and instead elevated art to the right path. Schopenhauer believed that in the intuition of artworks (in popular terms, perception and appreciation), one temporarily forgets the pursuit of the will (such as the intense craving for something), and thus the pain of living is temporarily alleviated. Of course, the intuition of art is only temporary, so art cannot permanently solve the suffering of life, but for the average person, asceticism or suicide are obviously not easy options.

4\. The Pathway of Creation

There is a pathway exclusive to art creators: the Pathway of Creation. Art creators can obtain solace through artistic creation. On one hand, this solace stems from the positive emotions gained by the creator during the process of creation. The following is a detailed description of these positive emotions:

(1) Forgetting troubles and gaining pleasure while focusing on artistic creation. Since humans can be single-minded when doing things, when an art creator focuses on creating an artwork they love, they may temporarily forget the troubles plaguing them and the unsatisfactory aspects of life.

(2) Compensating for the dissatisfactions of reality through fantasy and thereby obtaining solace. Many art creators use their imagination to conjure an ideal world different from real life, gaining positive emotions by compensating for various dissatisfactions encountered in reality. A typical example is Thomas More's Utopia.

(3) The pleasure of expression through voicing opinions via artistic creation. As social animals that use language, humans often have the desire to pour out their feelings. Sometimes, artists express what they want to say through artworks and thereby gain the pleasure of speaking. For example, Du Fu, the Sage of Poetry, who was concerned about the world, expressed his feelings of worry for his country and people through poetry when facing the tragic situation of a broken nation and suffering people, finding solace in doing so.

(4) Realizing unfulfilled desires through artistic creation. As Freud believed, dreams are the substitutes for unfulfilled desires. Art shares similarities with dreams—both possess the quality of fantasy. All artworks are born in the artist's fantasy; even artworks created using the unconscious and accidental factors (such as Pollock's "drip paintings") were at least within the creator's plan and conception before they were born. As a dream-maker, the art creator's works, like dreams, can serve to satisfy their unfulfilled desires. A relatively typical example is the so-called "Mary Sue fan fiction." (Mary Sue refers to a powerful, popular character conjured up by a fan fiction author, placed into an existing work to establish a connection with the protagonist). Aside from obtaining solace through the process of artistic creation, another aspect of the creation pathway comes from the results of creation (the artwork), which provide things that bring solace to the creator, such as honor and fame. In short, artistic creation can bring much solace to the creator, which is why so many people are willing to engage in it.

5\. The Pathway of Business

There is another pathway exclusive to art managers (artists who sell works, merchants dealing in art, etc.): the Pathway of Business. On one hand, art managers obtain profits through buying and selling artworks, and these profits (by improving their material life, satisfying their possessive desire for money, etc.) bring them solace, regardless of whether they are also art creators, appreciators, or collectors. Simultaneously, the process of business can also bring satisfaction and fun to the manager, which in turn provides solace.

6\. The Pathway of Collection

The final pathway is exclusive to art collectors: the Pathway of Collection. Art collectors obtain solace through collecting art. Regardless of what kind of item one loves to collect, the psychology of collecting involves the desire for possession. Possession sometimes gives people a sense of security and satisfaction, which in turn provides solace. If the desire to collect becomes deformed, it may develop into hoarding. Some people collect artworks to sell them for profit after they appreciate in value. This text classifies such behavior under business behavior.
