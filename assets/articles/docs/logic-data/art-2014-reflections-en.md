　　I recently came across an impassioned passage by Cheng Meixin (程美信) in "Qiu Zhijie Is Merely a Bridesmaid" (《邱志杰不过是个陪嫁伴娘》), defining the task of the artist:

>　　Qiu Zhijie's so-called "experimental art" refers to materials; its linguistic form is a direct imitation of Western postmodernism. This is acceptable as education or an attempt, but the crux is that they cannot engage with the actual Chinese context. This is because the experience of new art is based on post-industrial civilization and a middle-class society, whereas China not only lacks the postmodern artistic context and social foundation, but more importantly, the center of gravity of Chinese culture is to establish a social life with a broad middle class and rational order. The priority is to achieve breakthroughs in the political system, whether peacefully or through bloodshed. In short, without democracy and the rule of law, it is impossible to establish an era where the middle class constitutes the mainstream ideology, nor is it possible to have a stable middle-class society. In other words, current Chinese art, whether experimental or traditional, is consistent in its inability to change its internal anemia: specifically, the avoidance of reality and a reverence for totalitarianism. It fails to cut into the spiritual lifeblood of the times, instead acting to indulge autocracy, obscurantism, and kitsch entertainment. The original place of art is man and society, yet Chinese experimental art has generally fallen into a vacuum of formalism. It postures like someone chasing international fads, never reaching the stage of "political confrontation" described by Qiu Zhijie. There is no intrinsic difference between them and the traditional art of painting plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums; only the materials, means, and linguistic forms differ. Simply put, for all current culture and art in China, they must first break free from the suppression of despotism. Otherwise, they cannot achieve the liberation of their own creativity, nor can they return to their original state of freedom.

　　Cheng Meixin says: "For all current culture and art in China, they must first break free from the suppression of despotism; otherwise, they cannot achieve the liberation of their own creativity, nor can they return to their original state of freedom." This sentence implies that all current culture and art in China are suppressed by despotism. But how exactly is all current culture and art in China suppressed by despotism? Given that Cheng Meixin does not provide evidence for his viewpoint, I will temporarily reserve judgment on the possibility that he may be suffering from a persecution complex. Furthermore, what does the "original state of freedom" mentioned by Cheng refer to? If one claims that culture and art in China today are not free, then when exactly were Chinese culture and art ever free? In primitive society, ancient times, the modern era, or contemporary times?
Additionally, what kind of works count as "avoiding reality"? Based on Cheng Meixin's context, this so-called avoidance of reality likely refers to an indifference toward the current political status quo in China. According to Cheng's understanding, does an artist have to be fanatically committed to creating political art and dedicated to establishing a so-called social life with a broad middle class and rational order to be considered "not avoiding reality"? I fear this is Cheng Meixin's wishful definition of the artist's task. This definition likely stems from Cheng's personal ideals and aesthetic tastes, which in turn originate from a preference for social and political concern. However, if someone else were to discuss the artist's task, such as Schopenhauer, who held a negative and  nihilistic view of life, would undoubtedly praise those fatalistic, pessimistic artworks that are unrelated to politics and focus on the process of the destruction of the will to live. According to Schopenhauer's philosophy, politics, culture, and all human civilization are merely products of the will to live; they are meaningless and void, and this is precisely the reality of humanity. By Cheng Meixin's aesthetic standards, the art Schopenhauer adored would be "avoiding reality" and "anemic", whereas by Schopenhauer's aesthetic standards, Cheng Meixin's artistic ideal would lack a grasp of the essence of existence.
Let us consider an extreme example. Let us assume a person passionate about natural science views artists this way: "Natural science is the fundamental method for explaining the origin of the world. The highest task of an artist is to use art to represent natural science. Politics and culture are merely accidental products of biological evolution and humans are nothing but a collection of particles—this is reality! Artists who do not focus on these issues of natural science are simply avoiding reality and failing to cut into the spiritual lifeblood of the times!" To such a person, Cheng Meixin's artistic ideal would simply miss the point, failing to grasp the essence of existence and the pulse of the era.

　　At the same time, according to Cheng Meixin's definition of the political nature of the artist, a vast number of renowned artists in history would also be guilty of avoiding reality and would be far more "anemic" than Qiu Zhijie (after all, Qiu at least conducts social field research and engages in so-called "Total Art" reflecting the concepts of the masses). Take, for example, Corot, Constable, Turner, Monet, Van Gogh, etc., who painted landscapes—where is the "political confrontation" in these guys? And wouldn't Leonardo da Vinci, who was once employed by Cesare Borgia (son of Pope Alexander VI), be considered a running dog under a tyrant's door? Furthermore, Zhao Mengfu, a descendant of the Song imperial family who served as an official in the Yuan court, was not merely co-opted; he could practically be accused of betraying his ancestors! Of course, Cheng Meixin might say that one cannot compare past cases with the current artistic situation. However, in what sense is such a comparison valid? This involves the standards of artistic judgment. On this matter, Arthur Danto, who proclaimed the "end of art," might say that there are actually no standards left: "Nothing is more correct than anything else. There is no single direction." [1] Of course, philosophers of art and art critics may have different attitudes toward this issue. Philosophers can suspend value judgments or, like Wittgenstein, remain silent regarding that which cannot be spoken. However, art critics, in order to comment and critique, inevitably have to make value judgments. But what kind of judgments should be made? This is a question worth deep reflection.

　　Cheng Meixin believes that China lacks a postmodern artistic context and social foundation, and therefore Western postmodern art forms are difficult to take root in China. I beg to differ. I believe that the acceptance of new things requires a process. Contemporary artists need to have the spirit of pioneers; they cannot refrain from making avant-garde art simply because the public does not yet accept it. As for whether the public has accepted contemporary art, the success of Chinese contemporary artists precisely demonstrates the possibility of contemporary art taking root and sprouting in China.

　　Cheng Meixin's subtext is that the West possesses a postmodern artistic context and social foundation, and therefore is capable of accepting Western postmodern art forms. So, what is the degree of acceptance of postmodern art forms in the West?

　　In the early 1990s, there was a debate in France regarding the "value" of contemporary art. French philosopher and art critic Yves Michaud detailed the specifics of this discussion in his book The Crisis of Contemporary Art: The End of Utopia (La Crise de l'art contemporain). I cite here the surveys mentioned in this book regarding the public's understanding and aesthetics of art:

　　In January 1992, a survey conducted by the polling agency CSA for Beaux Arts Magazine showed: The "art" identified by the French refers primarily to painting (57%), surpassing music (29%) and literature (10%). Provided the nuances between concepts are fully understood, people did not equate art with culture (only 7%) nor with creativity (8%); for people, art is a precious, indispensable thing. It is a heritage of past creation, not equivalent to culture. People's understanding of art relies largely on intuition and inspiration, 78% of respondents evaluate artworks based on immediate feeling. Only 16% of respondents refer to relevant knowledge. When facing printed reproductions of original works, respondents' preferences focused on Balthus (47%), far exceeding Combas (15%), while Jean-Pierre Raynaud, Nam June Paik, and Yves Klein held almost no appeal. As for the perception of artists, respondents again favored painters (56%), still surpassing musicians (40%). Artists were also endowed with a popular romantic temperament: passionate, dreaming, workaholic, lonely, bohemian, eccentric, or even mad. Topping the list of artists is Van Gogh, surpassing Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Picasso (43%–31%), while Buren fell to the tail end, recognized by only 1% of respondents.
Once action is required, the love for art seems to cool: exhibitions, galleries, and museums are "somewhat" rather than "very" attractive, sometimes even "not very" attractive. Most respondents had never purchased original art or reproductions, and the reasons for purchase focused primarily on decorative function (45%). Public support was considered a good thing, and everyone trusted the state and market support for the art world. The happy moral ending is that speculation was universally condemned. [2]

　　In 1996, a survey result published by the Department of Studies and Foresight (DEP) of the Ministry of Culture showed the evolution of art lovers' interests since the 1970s: One in every two French people has had or still maintains a hobby of artistic practice. The younger the age, the higher the proportion of this practice.
Specifically regarding plastic arts, the proportion of enthusiasts participating in practice ranges between 18% for the youngest and 8% for the oldest, depending on the age group. The content of these hobbies is extremely traditional: sketching, watercolor, and oil painting have the largest practicing population. There are no objects or photographic collages, and even fewer installation creations. Techniques are usually self-taught, aiming for relaxation and entertainment. Most people lean towards figurative creation, finding satisfaction in the critiques of friends and family.

　　What is interesting is the degree of ignorance and rejection people have towards contemporary painting.
Art lovers visit traditional art museums more frequently than modern art museums. Their tendency to buy works or reproductions is not stronger than other groups. They prefer Impressionism, liking Van Gogh, Renoir, and Monet, while loathing Picasso, Dalí, and Buffet—or perhaps the latter receives this treatment for being a well-known "modern" painter. Overall, their ignorance of contemporary art is greater than their rejection of it, but regarding contemporary art "specifically", it is a resolute rejection. Even tolerance for dreams does not exist. [3]

　　It is evident that even in France, the public's acceptance of contemporary art is not high. French contemporary artists did not stop moving forward because of this, so what is the reason why Chinese artists should not practice contemporary art? I believe that Cheng Meixin's evaluation of Qiu Zhijie's art is overly influenced by his political fanaticism and the resulting values, to the point of being too biased. Must an excellent artist confront politics? Otherwise, are they "anemic"? This assertion cannot help but remind me of the black-and-white mindset of Christians who believe that those who do not believe in God are heretics and deserve to go to hell.
