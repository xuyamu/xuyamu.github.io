> 　　— Heidegger, *What Are Poets For?*

　　This April, I received a birthday gift from a distant friend—Heidegger's *Being and Time*. Although I had long heard the name of this important 20th-century philosopher, I never had the opportunity to read his works. Upon receiving the book, I impatiently opened this work, which is not particularly thick yet extremely rich in content. Heidegger's writings are notoriously obscure and difficult. As I gnawed through the book, half-understanding yet filled with excitement, those profound words left an extremely deep impression on me. When I read:

> 　　"...that which threatens is **nowhere**. **Anxiety** 'does not know' what that in the face of which it is anxious is. But **nowhere** does not signify nothing: in it lies region in general, and the disclosedness of the world in general for essentially spatial **Being-in**. Therefore, that which threatens cannot draw near from a definite direction within the neighborhood; it is already 'there'—and yet **nowhere**; it is so close that it is oppressive and stifles one's breath—and yet **nowhere**." (*Being and Time*, Section 40: The Fundamental State-of-Mind of Anxiety as a Distinctive Way in which Dasein is Disclosed)

　　An inexplicable resonance surged in my heart. I could finally no longer hold back the emotion within, and tears streamed down my face.

　　I remember living in the countryside as a child. In the summer, as night fell, every household would move bamboo beds out to the riverside to enjoy the cool air. The summer night sky was beautiful, but I never dared to gaze at the profound starry sky for too long; staring at the stars terrified me. Perhaps starting from the age of 16, this inexplicable emotion, similar to what I felt gazing at the stars as a child, frequently appeared in me. When I looked up at the stars, when I thought about the vastness of the universe, when I reflected on myself, this emotion would quietly visit. This emotion made me feel an inexplicable fear and anxiety, making me feel my own insignificance and awkwardness amidst a chaotic world. At these moments, everything around me seemed no longer familiar; I saw a strange world, full of the unknown and threats. If this anxiety were constant, I might have been medically classified as suffering from "Generalized Anxiety Disorder."

　　I first found resonance for this experience in Pascal and Schopenhauer. "The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me." Pascal, the great mathematical genius and ascetic, found solace in God. Schopenhauer, on the other hand, the pessimistic yet rational nihilist, was puzzled by the meaning of life throughout his life. The fear of the unknown and death accompanied him always. At the moment before his death, he wrote a sentence: "We are finally liberated." Then, with a smile of relief, he left this world that he both loved and hated.

　　Heidegger calls this special emotional experience "**anxiety**" (*Angst*). *Angst* in German means anxiety ①, but Heidegger's so-called "**anxiety**" differs from ordinary anxiety in that it is not directed at a specific, visible, or expectable thing. This is because *that in the face of which one has anxiety* is **Being-in-the-world** as such. This emotional experience is considered by Heidegger to be the fundamental state-of-mind of authentic **Dasein** (the state of understanding and questioning Being). Heidegger's **Dasein** is the entity that inquires into Being (Dasein is the definition of the human being).

　　How does this "**anxiety**" arise? I have been thinking about this question. I believe the most important reason for falling into the state of "**anxiety**" lies in the lack of meaning in life. What is the state of lacking life's meaning? Let us first examine the concept of "meaning." Meaning is a daily term, but it is not used very frequently in daily life because meaning is a relatively abstract concept, and common sentences built on daily trivia can proceed very well without involving the concept of meaning. In daily life, we encounter the following usages of meaning:

1.  **"What is the meaning of you doing this?"** This sentence is usually used as a rhetorical question. In this sentence, "meaning" usually implies usefulness, something beneficial, or something of value. The usage of meaning here involves values; here, "meaning" is defined via certain values. For example, someone says: "You tried every way to help him, but he isn't grateful at all. What is the meaning of you doing this?"
2.  **"Living like this is so meaningless to me!"** The person saying this usually concludes this after observing the lives of others and comparing them with their own, or when they have been in a failing position in life for a long time. For example, someone says: "He never studies seriously yet his grades are so good, while I study hard and earnestly every day, yet my grades are still so poor. Living like this is too meaningless!" Here, "meaning" refers to being valuable or beneficial.
3.  **"What is the meaning of this event?"** This is a comparatively formal sentence with a reflective and questioning nature. It is basically not used in the mass public's life (reasons will be discussed later). However, anyone who has taken history or political ideology classes has encountered such questions. For example, an essay question on an exam: "What is the meaning of the Revolution of 1911?" Here, meaning still refers to the good aspects of a thing, the profound laws behind it. We would not see a question like: "What was the meaning of the Cultural Revolution?" Here, "meaning" refers to the (good) aspects of a thing and its effect on other things.

　　In summary, meaning carries implications such as the valuable aspects of a thing or its beneficial effects. Generally speaking, meaning is a commendatory term. Some people understand meaning as "human cognition of natural or social affairs." I feel this understanding is too broad and lacks a basis in everyday language, so this discussion will not adopt this definition.

　　The sense of lack regarding life's meaning stems from the absence of life's meaning. How is the absence of life's meaning formed? A sense of lack is a feeling, a personalized experience. So how is this personalized experience formed? When we say we lack something, we must already be aware of the existence of that thing. We might have possessed this thing once and now do not, or perhaps we never had it. But in many cases, we possess things without realizing it. For most people, the meaning of life is implicit; the meaning of life lies in the various trivialities of daily life.

　　This state of unconsciousness regarding life's meaning is similar to what Heidegger calls the state of "**the They**" (*das Man*): "Dasein drifts along in 'the They', drifts along in the 'world' it concerns itself with. This drifting reveals that Dasein flees in the face of itself, and this is a fleeing in the face of the authentic potentiality-for-Being-itself." Dasein, as the entity that inquires into Being, inquires precisely into the meaning of life. "The They" evade this inquiry because they are unwilling or unable to inquire. They are unwilling because such questioning is painful; they are unable because their consciousness of their own existence is too vague to capture this experience in language, and inquiry must be carried by language. One does not feel a sense of lack for what one has never been conscious of, even if it is lost. Therefore, the precondition for the lack of life's meaning lies in *caring* about life's meaning. This caring is first embodied in our question: "What is the meaning of life?" ("The They" do not ask this question because, for them, the meaning of life is taken for granted and requires no questioning.)

　　Some people, when asking such questions, quickly find answers for themselves (for example, living for parents, for the people, for the country, or for God, or other things they consider valuable) and end the inquiry. But in extreme cases, a person committed to exhaustive reasoning is unsatisfied with the answers found. He doubts continuously, he seeks tirelessly. In this seeking, he loses the meaning of life. The loss of meaning causes him to lose the basis of survival. Heidegger calls this state of losing the basis of survival the "Abyss" (*Abgrund*: *Ab* means cancellation/loss, *grund* means foundation/ground).

　　"Philosophy is really a homesickness, an urge to be at home everywhere." The German Romantic Novalis lamented not without sadness. To lose the meaning of life is to lose the ultimate spiritual anchorage. Thus, such an exhaustive inquirer falls into a dazed state. Heidegger uses *unheimlich* to describe this state. *Unheimlich* means homeless (uncanny). (*Heim* means "home," *heimlich* means "homely/familiar," *unheimlich* means "unhomely/unfamiliar.") Lacking the warmth of home, a person will "feel a nameless terror and be at a loss." The meaning of life is the spiritual home; the home is lost, and Dasein becomes a wanderer. This nameless terror and bewilderment of losing one's home is "**anxiety**."

　　Heidegger says: "That for which **anxiety** is anxious is **Being-in-the-world** itself." That which **anxiety** dreads is distinguished from "fear" (*Furcht*). That which fear is afraid of is a specific, targeted thing. However, the **anxiety** arising from the loss of life's meaning is a dread and fear directed at all existence. Fear can be resolved by eliminating the fearful object, but **anxiety** cannot be resolved by eliminating the object of dread, because this object is existence itself. But **anxiety** can be eliminated by fleeing—that is, by falling into "the They." Yet, for an authentic Dasein, once the mind is clear, it is perhaps impossible to ever return to the fallen state. However, **anxiety** is rare. To experience and encounter **anxiety** requires a spirit of radical skepticism and reflection, as well as an extremely sensitive soul. Those who possess both are likely only a minority of thinkers.

　　A classmate once said to me: "I really envy you; you never worry or fret about life." However, this is a beautiful misunderstanding ②. That warm hometown has long since left me. I have become a homeless wanderer, roaming everywhere under the starlight, in the dark night...

① *A note on the cause of anxiety: From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, anxiety is a defensive psychological mechanism that helps organisms avoid danger. Without a sense of fear, organisms would not know to avoid danger. Animals that do not know to avoid danger would inevitably fail in the struggle for survival and be eliminated by nature. Therefore, anxiety, a psychological mechanism beneficial to biological survival, was preserved under the action of natural selection.*

② *This classmate only saw my tendency to get excited easily (especially my low threshold for laughter, making me look like I'm always in high spirits) and my personality of not fussing over life's trifles. To this, I can only smile bitterly. Firstly, I worry that my confiding would only add to her sorrows; secondly, perhaps she could never experience any of my sorrows, so even if I refuted her, she could not understand. There is a popular misunderstanding: "Only sentimental/perceptual people are melancholic." This misunderstanding is based on the popular understanding of rationality: rationality is an attitude or character of being calm, organized, realistic, etc. This understanding is formed through the observation and simple classification of people in reality and influenced by opinions widely circulated in society. (People with this understanding usually consider artists to be "sentimental/perceptual"; in reality, this lacks detailed and serious examination. They usually think rational people lack passion and are cold and unfeeling.) In fact, a person with a highly logical mind can also be sentimental, it is just that the object of this sentimentality differs from the object of sentimentality for those so-called "emotional" people.*
