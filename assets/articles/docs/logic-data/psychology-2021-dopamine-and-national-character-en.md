&emsp;&emsp;There is a well-known gene affecting dopamine levels that is believed to be associated with violence levels; this gene is called the MAO-A (monoamine oxidase A) gene. This gene affects the level of the MAO-A enzyme in the human body, which breaks down monoamine neurotransmitters (including catecholamines and indoleamines; catecholamines include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, while indoleamines are primarily serotonin). People with low MAO-A expression have more monoamine neurotransmitters. Animal experiments show that mice lacking MAO-A exhibit more aggressive behavior. A study of Finnish criminals (J Tiihonen et al., 2014) showed that criminals with low-level MAO-A expression committed more violent crimes, and the paper speculated that low-level dopamine and serotonin metabolism (meaning high levels of dopamine and serotonin) is the cause of higher aggression. Another study on the MAO-A 2R gene and criminal behavior (Guang Guo et al., 2008) showed that individuals carrying the MAO-A 2R gene scored higher on a severe and violent behavior scale test than those with the MAO-A 3R and MAO-A 4R genes (indicating more violent criminal behavior). Individuals with 2R have two variable number tandem repeats (VNTR) in their MAO-A gene, those with 3R have three repeats, and those with 4R have four repeats. The greater the number of repeats, the more MAO-A enzyme is produced, and the stronger the ability to break down monoamine neurotransmitters (resulting in lower levels of monoamine neurotransmitters). According to the relevant wiki entry (Monoamine oxidase A - WikiMili, The Free Encyclopedia), 5.5% of Black people carry the MAO-A 2R allele, 0.1% of Caucasian people carry the MAO-A 2R allele, while only 0.00067% of Asian people carry the MAO-A 2R allele. This might explain the difference in crime rates among these three racial groups.

&emsp;&emsp;However, what we need to know is that a person carrying an MAO-A gene that expresses a lower level of MAO-A enzyme does not mean this person will be a violent criminal, because there are many other genes that affect criminal behavior (such as CDH13), and the impact of the acquired environment cannot be ignored. For example, a study (Fergusson et al., 2011) showed that individuals carrying an MAO-A gene expressing lower levels of the MAO-A enzyme are more likely to develop behavioral problems in adulthood if they suffer abuse during childhood. Criminal behavior is complex and multi-causal, and the MAO-A gene only plays a small part in it.

&emsp;&emsp;Since high levels of dopamine easily promote violent criminal behavior, are there any benefits to having more dopamine? A study on Parkinson's patients (Eugénie Lhommée et al., 2014) showed that patients taking more dopamine agonists have higher creativity. This paper points out that dopamine and creativity are at least partially correlated.

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the above paper, we know that increasing dopamine levels through medication can enhance creativity. So, what is the relationship between dopamine and creativity at the genetic level?

&emsp;&emsp;A gene related to dopamine is the COMT gene. COMT (catechol-O-methyltransferase) translates to "儿茶酚-O-甲基转移酶" in Chinese. The COMT enzyme plays a crucial role in dopamine degradation in the prefrontal cortex. Among its variants, the COMT gene with the Met allele leads to lower levels of the COMT enzyme, resulting in higher levels of dopamine. A study on the relationship between average personality traits and genes in different countries (F. INGLEHART et al., 2014) showed that the Met allele of the COMT gene is positively correlated with Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness in the Big Five Facets, and negatively correlated with Neuroticism. Among these, the positive correlation with Openness is the largest of the five traits. The full name of Openness is "Openness to experience". According to the Big Five Facets theory, individuals with high openness are more curious, imaginative, and appreciative of aesthetics, and they like to try new things and challenge authority.

Here is the relevant table:
<figure>
	<img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/dopamine01.webp">
	<figcaption>S Allele Frequency of the 5-HTTLPR Gene</figcaption>
</figure>

Furthermore, according to this table, we find that the frequency of the S allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene is positively correlated with Neuroticism in the Big Five Facets. Here is the chart from this paper showing the frequency of the COMT Met allele in different countries and regions:

<figure>
	<img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/dopamine02.webp">
	<figcaption>COMT Met Allele Frequency</figcaption>
</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;From the table, we can see that the COMT Met allele frequency of Chinese people is relatively low (and it clusters with several East Asian countries or regions, among which Japan's COMT Met allele frequency is slightly higher). Another paper published in Scientific Reports, "Dopamine genes are linked to Extraversion and Neuroticism personality traits, but only in demanding climates," also pointed out that East Asian samples have relatively low Extraversion and higher Neuroticism, and a lower dopamine index.

&emsp;&emsp;This article also provides the frequency of the short allele of 5-HTTLPR for samples from different countries and regions:

<figure>
	<img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/dopamine03.webp">
	<figcaption>Frequency of the 5-HTTLPR Short Allele in Samples from Different Countries and Regions</figcaption>
</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;From the chart, we can see that the frequency of the 5-HTTLPR short (S) allele is relatively high in several East Asian countries or regions. In the Big Five Facets, the Neuroticism dimension is related to emotional stability; people with high Neuroticism are prone to negative emotions such as depression and anxiety. 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region) translates to the serotonin transporter gene promoter region. The long and short alleles in this region can control the expression of serotonin transporters, thereby affecting human emotions. A study on the correlation between 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism and depression in Han Chinese (Zhang Lan et al., 2008) showed that the 5-HTTLPR S allele genotype is a risk gene for depression (however, this research area is highly debated, and some studies show no correlation between 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism and depression). Additionally, a study on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in children and adolescents and 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism (Gen Li Li Wang et al., 2019) showed that compared to carriers of the L allele, individuals with the SS genotype had higher initial symptom severity, but faster symptom recovery rates. A meta-analysis on 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism and anxiety-related personality traits (R. Munafò et al., 2010) showed that Neuroticism in the Big Five Facets may be related to 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism (highly neurotic individuals are more likely to carry one or two 5-HTTLPR S alleles). Another study (Luo YLL et al., 2017) showed that individuals carrying the 5-HTTLPR S allele genotype are more prone to nostalgia.

&emsp;&emsp;In addition, I found a Big Five Facets survey targeting 56 different regions and countries (the samples were college students):

&emsp;&emsp;The Geographic Distribution of Big Five Personality Traits: Patterns and Profiles of Human Self-Description Across 56 Nations

&emsp;&emsp;Here is the list given in the paper (note that the figures in the table are not raw scores, but converted T-Scores):
<figure>
	<img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/dopamine04.webp">
	<figcaption>Big Five Personality Survey Across Different Regions and Countries</figcaption>

</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;From the text, we can see that the Extraversion and Openness dimensions of the samples from several East Asian countries and regions are on the lower side, while Neuroticism is on the higher side. What surprised me is that the samples from East Asian countries and regions also have no advantage in Conscientiousness. People with high Conscientiousness are self-disciplined, purpose-driven, responsible, and organized. Notably, the Conscientiousness of the Japanese sample is particularly low. People with low Conscientiousness are lazy, procrastinating, and lack goals, which might explain why the phenomena of "hikikomori" (shut-ins) and NEETs are so popular in Japan.

&emsp;&emsp;Here is another chart from this paper, which uses raw means and 95% probability sample confidence interval error bars:

	<figcaption>Extraversion Dimension</figcaption>
</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;From this chart, we can see that the East Asian samples are the lowest in the Extraversion dimension. This chart shows that the East Asian samples have the highest Neuroticism:

	<figcaption>Neuroticism Dimension</figcaption>
</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;So, what is the relationship between the Big Five Facets traits and creativity? A study on the Big Five Facets and creativity (Sun Young Sung et al., 2009) showed a positive correlation between Extraversion, Openness, and creative performance. The sample used in this study was a group of students and their classroom performance; the criteria for measuring creative performance included behaviors such as whether students provided new ideas or different perspectives in class, and whether they raised interesting topics and challenging questions for discussion.

&emsp;&emsp;Another study (Paul J. Silvia et al., 2009) used multiple scales and tests to measure the relationship between the Big Five Facets and creativity. This study found that Openness is the strongest predictor of creativity scores.

&emsp;&emsp;Let's look again at relevant studies on dopamine-related genes and personality:

&emsp;&emsp;"Relationship between dopamine system genes and extraversion and novelty seeking." This study shows that for women, individuals with the Met/Met genotype are more likely to have the novelty-seeking trait than those with the Val/Val and Val/Met genotypes. People with this trait like to explore new things and pursue excitement. A paper written by Chinese researchers, "Sex Modulates the Associations Between the COMT Gene and Personality Traits," shows that males carrying the Val/Val genotype (the sample being Han Chinese males) scored lower in novelty-seeking. This study found that the effect of the COMT gene differs significantly between males and females, having a greater impact on males. The paper mentions a possible reason: women with high estrogen have lower COMT activity; the interaction between gender differences and the COMT gene leads to the different effects of the COMT gene on men and women.

There is a table in this paper showing the proportions of different genotypes:
<figure>
	<img src="assets/articles/images/logic-data/dopamine07.webp">
	<figcaption>Proportions of Different COMT Genotypes</figcaption>
</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;From this table, we can see that the frequency of the Met gene is indeed not high among Chinese people, which is consistent with the research results mentioned earlier.

&emsp;&emsp;"Novelty seeking is linked to openness and extraversion, and can lead to greater creative performance." This study shows that the novelty-seeking trait is positively correlated with Openness and Extraversion, and that the novelty-seeking trait leads to stronger divergent thinking.

&emsp;&emsp;Earlier we mentioned that more Black people carry the MAO-A 2R allele. Does this make the Black population more creative? Many studies show a correlation between creativity and intelligence. There is a concept in academia regarding intelligence and creativity called the threshold hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that below a certain IQ level, a higher IQ correlates with higher creativity; once past this threshold, creativity is influenced by other factors. Therefore, high dopamine levels do not necessarily mean high creativity; creativity still has an intelligence threshold.

&emsp;&emsp;Returning to our initial question, is it possible that dopamine levels affect the development of an ethnic group or a country? By querying the global city and country user-contributed database (Crime Index by Country 2020), we find that the crime rates in China, Japan, and South Korea are relatively low. Based on the above text, we know that the dopamine genes of East Asian peoples tend to possess related genes that lead to low dopamine levels, particularly a low frequency of MAO-A 2R. This might be one of the reasons for the lower crime rates in East Asian countries. Of course, crime rates are also closely related to national systems and the economy. High-welfare countries like Denmark, Norway, and Iceland do not have high crime rates, but we all know that the ancestors of these peoples produced the Vikings, who were renowned for their fierceness and aggressiveness.

&emsp;&emsp;However, the frequency of the COMT Met gene, which has a positive impact on Openness, is relatively low among East Asian peoples. Statistical results regarding personality also show that the Extraversion and Openness dimensions of East Asian peoples are low. This might explain why Europeans, rather than East Asians, initiated the Age of Discovery. Furthermore, since Openness is correlated with creativity, low Openness might have an adverse effect on the creativity of East Asian peoples. This might be one of the reasons why East Asian countries have lagged behind in modern technological development (although some studies show that East Asians exhibit slight advantages in IQ test scores).

&emsp;&emsp;Why is the frequency of the COMT Met allele relatively low among East Asians? I guess one of the reasons is related to East Asian countries having been agrarian societies for a long time. Farming work has a very low demand for the novelty-seeking trait, Openness, and Extraversion. On the other hand, many of the ancestors of the people in Denmark, Norway, and Iceland were Vikings. Being a pirate requires the courage to take risks and the desire for outward expansion, which creates a high demand for the novelty-seeking trait and Extraversion. As mentioned earlier, research shows that people carrying the 5-HTTLPR S allele genotype are more prone to nostalgia, which might be one of the cultural roots of ancestor worship among Chinese people.

&emsp;&emsp;It is worth mentioning that many drugs used to treat neurodegenerative diseases and depression can increase dopamine levels. For instance, the COMT inhibitor entacapone increases dopamine by inhibiting COMT; Madopar (levodopa and benserazide) increases dopamine via a dopamine precursor; and amantadine, which is used as human medicine (for neurodegenerative diseases and colds) as well as veterinary medicine (for influenza), can promote dopamine release. If everyone is interested, I can write an article to popularize the science behind these drugs.
