&emsp;&emsp;Recently, my good friend, Chenji de Xiangliangchang (Silent Vector Field) from Douban, and I had some discussions on topics related to human cloning. I have organized it and posted it here:
###### **Yamu:** 
&emsp;&emsp;Opposing human cloning might stem from the following reasons:
1. Fear of the unknown. Clones are entities that have never appeared in the world before; they are unknown. People fear unknown things and lack sufficient curiosity to counter this fear. They likely also lack sufficient critical thinking skills to consider the possible outcomes.
2. Satisfaction with the existing order. They are content with the current ethical order, and because they fear the unknown, they desperately oppose others establishing a new order.
3. Lack of reflection on ethics. They stubbornly believe that the traditional ethical order is the absolute truth, without considering the evolutionary significance of humans adopting sexual reproduction and the significance of the development of reproductive technologies. Sexual reproduction exists for faster evolution, but the development of biotechnology can gradually interfere with the speed of human evolution. Humans no longer need to rely solely on natural selection to evolve, so sexual reproduction is no longer humanity's only option.
###### **Chenji:** 
&emsp;&emsp;The restrictions on human cloning actually come from legal difficulties. First, the law can be divided into three stages:
1. Before the birth of a clone, a universally accepted law needs to be passed. After all, individuals have the absolute freedom to govern their own lives. If the emergence of clones interferes with individuals and brings inconvenience to the lives of people around them, they might naturally vote against it.
2. After the birth of clones, the supervision and management of cloning technology (identity registration in all public places, the adjustment and new division of various rights in public and private spheres).
3. Laws regarding clones. Besides enjoying the same rights as ordinary people, should further legal restrictions be imposed on clones? A common foreseeable trouble is this example: an ordinary person chooses to have only one clone of themselves made, without any intention of having more clones. But if the clone then chooses to have a clone made of themselves, it essentially results in two clones of the original ordinary person. Considering that this was not the original person's intention, this requires negotiation; otherwise, the original person's right to self-determination regarding cloning is stripped away. However, assuming the original person legally does not need anyone else's consent to be cloned, this would mean the first clone needs the original person's consent to be cloned. This means ordinary people and clones cannot be guaranteed equal rights legally, which undoubtedly implies an inequality in social status between ordinary people and clones.
&emsp;&emsp;After all, a question involved here is: does an individual have the right to determine the number of their clones in society? Or can they only determine the number of clones made directly from themselves? But cloning seems to have transitivity. If A is cloned into B, and B is cloned into C, how much difference is there between that and A being cloned into C? Of course, if identity tracking is extremely strict, then when verifying identity, not only the clone's own information will appear, but also information about who they were cloned from, and perhaps even which generation of clone they are... If these technologies do not keep up, it means the law cannot effectively restrict this, and it indeed cannot guarantee that society can accept the existence of clones... This includes the scenario where, if A chooses to be cloned, almost everyone who knows A will face the situation of confusing A and "A's clone." The issue involved here is A's acquaintances' "right to refuse being confused," which is also one of the moral rights protected by law. After all, even "copyright law" protects "moral rights." So does this mean that even if the law permits cloning technology, A should obtain the consent of certain people before choosing to be cloned? This is different from traditional reproduction. A person has no right to demand that their children must or must not have children, and the law does not protect a person's decision-making power in this regard. But the law must acknowledge an individual's "autonomy," and this autonomy entails "freedom from identity confusion." Someone once proposed referencing the "right of reproduction" in "copyright" to regulate laws concerning cloning, but clones are, after all, not just reproductions of works, nor can they be destroyed at will. Reproductions in copyright have no thoughts; they only express thoughts but do not possess decision-making ability (reproductions are still inseparable from the author). Therefore, the focus is on protecting the author's copyright. Clones are different, but even so, protecting ordinary people's rights in cloning cannot be entirely divorced from the concept of "copyright."
###### **Yamu:**
1. How would clones interfere with other people's lives? Besides the original body and their relatives and friends, would it interfere with anyone else's life? Many people tend to make moral judgments about people and matters entirely unrelated to themselves, such as criticizing homosexuals, sexual liberationists, etc. This moral judgment mechanism stems from a stable strategy generated by evolutionary games. This strategy might have been very effective in primitive tribes; after all, a tribe has a small population, and a few unconventional individuals might affect the entire tribe. But in today's society, this strategy clearly needs to be reconsidered.
2. The regulation of cloning technology can reference the relevant laws for test-tube babies. The only difference between cloning an infant and birthing an infant lies in the genetic similarity. Some people are afraid of the appearance of someone who looks just like them—this is probably an important psychological factor against human cloning.
3. This is indeed a problem, but it can be compared to family issues. The clone and the original body are equivalent to child and parents. Parents might interfere with their children's marriage and childbearing issues (not allowing children to marry so-and-so, not allowing them to be gay, etc.), but the law does not interfere with this.
&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** It's different, let's not digress too far. The "interference" of clones and things like homosexuality or asexuality are completely different matters. To give a simple example, if you clone a "you," then everyone who knows you will be troubled by confusing you and your clone, unless there is a way to guarantee strict identity tracking, but current technology is far from achieving this. I have already answered your question; please be patient and read my reply. I already stated this is different from parents having no right to interfere with their children's marriage, because ordinary reproduction has autonomy—that is, parents having children, and children having grandchildren, does not mean parents are having grandchildren... But cloning is similar to copying; it is transitive. This interference is actually akin to "an author must interfere to ensure their work is not copied without their permission." Although clones cannot be simply viewed as copies, issues similar to the "right of reproduction" still require similar consideration for the very first person in the cloning chain. "Some people are afraid of the appearance of someone who looks just like them—this is probably an important psychological factor against human cloning," yes, this is the key. Existing laws cannot find a basis to deny this right, which is also where the difficulty lies.
&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** They would only be confused if their ages are close. If this is a problem, wouldn't identical multiple births also be a problem? Family planning could be implemented to control the number of clones; otherwise, making a whole bunch would indeed be hard to identify. Also, age issues could be regulated, such as stipulating that one must reach a certain age to clone oneself, equivalent to advocating late childbearing. The essence of the struggle for survival lies in passing on genes. Sexual reproduction is essentially also for better gene transmission. Having offspring by cloning oneself is also a way of passing on genes. Favoring one over the other is probably just a rigid, conventional mindset.
&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Of course, you think survival is for passing on genes, just like an author authorizing the reproduction of their work is to disseminate it more widely, and reproducing their work is disseminating their thoughts. But this does not mean the author allows their work to be copied unconditionally; this is crucial. The law has no way to dismiss this right. Identical twins do not involve the issue of "authorized reproduction" because a person giving birth to identical twins is entirely a personal matter; no one else will imitate this person and produce another pair of similar identical twins. So this is different from "human cloning." You can't really call it "favoring one over the other," after all, isn't copyright precisely a manifestation of this so-called "favoring"?
&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** The family ethics that pit parents and children against each other stem partly from the fear of incest and traditional ethics. In fact, the essence is still the transmission of genes. Of course, it is very difficult to make people with weak comprehension skills realize this. The law could stipulate that if a person wants to clone themselves, they must give up their uniqueness and allow their clone to clone themselves; if they cannot accept this, they shouldn't clone. This is equivalent to parents being unable to stop their own children from marrying and having children.
&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Regulating age might be a solution, similar to the validity period of copyright, meaning at what age a clone can allow themselves to be copied. However, the issue with copyright is that one can apply for an extension of the validity period. So could "clones" do something similar? That is, the original person applies to extend the validity period, but this conflicts with the "decision-making right" of the "clone" to decide whether to produce a new clone.
&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** You should draw analogies with marriage law and family planning; this matter is quite different from copyright. If you figure out the biological essence of human ethics (gene transmission, survival games), many problems are no longer problems. The biggest problem is how to make humans with traditional views on marriage and low intelligence understand the essence of human cloning. The reason technology can develop is that it doesn't provoke aversion; for instance, various technologies that make human life convenient. Pure theoretical research is not opposed because ordinary people don't understand it.
&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** It still has some connection to copyright. Cloning, in its effect, is transitive. For example, suppose a person chooses to have a clone made from themselves 20 years later, and that clone chooses to make another clone 20 years after that. In effect, this is equivalent to the original person choosing to make another clone 40 years later. Of course, it is necessary to inform the original person beforehand, before they make the decision, that once they decide to clone, they will henceforth have no right to determine how many clones they have, even while they are alive. Whether this right should be relinquished simultaneously with the decision to clone remains highly controversial. Pure theoretical research is also still conducted under effective legal supervision, which includes a series of regulatory issues like institutions approving cloning technology after legislation. When a person goes to the hospital to have a child, the process of "having a child" is not supervised in the same way.

&emsp;&emsp;"If you figure out the biological essence of human ethics (gene transmission, survival games), many problems are no longer problems." Similarly, one could also say, "If you figure out the ideological essence of human creation of works (transmission of ideas, continuous contribution of new knowledge, making human knowledge structures richer, more systematic, and deeper), many problems are no longer problems." But this faces challenges from "copyright."

&emsp;&emsp;Of course, considerations of "copyright" stem from the fact that a person's creative achievements mean something, such as profit and reputation (influence). After all, if the author's "copyright" is not protected, many people would seize the benefits that should belong to the author during the process of reproduction and dissemination. The current question is: "Should the rights of the very first person in this regard be protected?" Assuming this right is not protected, does it also mean that the clones and cloning institutions become the biggest profiteers in this process, while many of the interests of the person who initially provided the genes are seized by the institutions and subsequent clones, thus receiving no protection?

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** The pure theory I just mentioned refers to all scientific research, including mathematics and physics ←_← Ordinary people completely can't understand it and generally won't bother with it, so they won't feel aversion to it.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** It's not quite the same. What is the experimental subject of the biological experiment of cloning? Isn't it humans? The key to the problem is that only through supervision can we ensure that the institution is indeed conducting pure theoretical research; otherwise, it would be highly suspicious if the institution itself engaged in other applications (after all, the social consequences brought about by other applications are not pure theoretical research isolated from the public).

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** If a person wants to clone themselves, they must be prepared to give up certain rights. The difference between a child born through cloning and an ordinary child is that they share highly similar genes with their parent. How does this ordinary parent-child relationship differ? What problems might arise? These are the issues that need to be considered. Even in natural reproduction, children might look like their parents, as long as the parents are similar enough. People who are already preparing to clone themselves as children have definitely thought this through. So the main problem is what the people around the clone will think.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** This is the legal issue of the first stage.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:**  This is probably the biggest obstacle; humans like to make moral judgments or various evaluations of others. Cloned children might face discrimination, but ordinary children, if they possess certain traits (poor, short, ugly, dumb, etc.), will also face contempt and disdain. The survival pressure on these children is probably no less than that on cloned children.

&emsp;&emsp;Some people fear human cloning out of this mentality: I am a loser (diaosi); if women all have children through cloning, are men still needed? Rich, handsome, and successful (gaofushuai) men will all clone themselves, and I don't have the money to clone. Unfair! Some people oppose parthenogenesis and homosexuality out of a similar mentality (there are so few girls already, if a pair becomes lesbians, my chances of finding a girlfriend decrease; men being gay is too disgusting...). They can't fathom that their inability to get a wife isn't because of what others are doing, but because they themselves are inadequate.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** This is based on the assumption that when the law permits cloning technology, people will scramble to clone themselves, and only then will there be the "sour grapes" mentality you mentioned. But this assumption itself has no basis.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** What do you mean no basis? There are people right now who think this way. Didn't you see that in the thread I posted, there were people who thought exactly like this, which is why they opposed parthenogenesis. Then someone replied that if females can undergo parthenogenesis, males can too, so it's fair. The losers expressed that they don't understand these profound theories; they just feel it's bad ←_← A few science students and tech geeks in the forum are very welcoming of parthenogenesis and cloning technologies. We are all very evil!

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** I mean, under what circumstances does a person want to clone themselves? Compared to opposing cloning, understanding the mentality of "wanting to clone oneself" is also indispensable. When the losers realize that actually no one wants to proactively clone themselves, this psychological reaction won't be as strong.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** Narcissists. There are even people who marry themselves ←_←

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** There's also the question: if a person clones themselves, and later wants a child, are they prohibited from reproducing naturally? Otherwise, the child and the clone will face an identity crisis directly.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** Since we are talking about the law, we can only follow family planning... By identity issue, do you mean how the child should view their cloned siblings?

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Right, the child eventually discovers that their siblings look almost exactly the same as their parents...

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** Just tell the child the truth ←_← The cloned child also discovers that they look exactly the same as their parent.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Suppose a person is only allowed to clone themselves once in their lifetime; that could avoid the child sequentially encountering two clones among their peers and the next generation. Here, the child refers to one born normally or adopted.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** People might consider whether children have the right to choose to live an ordinary life or a bizarre life... I'm afraid we'll have to wait until various unconventional views on marriage and love become mainstream before people slowly accept clones. This requires an acceptance process. Many technologies that benefit humanity are accepted slowly; it can't be rushed.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** How does human cloning technology benefit humanity? Or rather, how does it improve social life? This probably needs careful examination.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** It satisfies the needs of a segment of humanity ←_← I support the right of eccentric people to choose their preferred method of passing on genes.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** What if the genes are defective?

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** "I'm only having a child with someone else because I can't have one myself, I was forced to!" (imitating the tone of someone who wants to clone themselves). What kind of defects?

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Or carrying a familial genetic disease. Generally speaking, this situation is isolated in a normal reproductive environment. So, with the advent of cloning technology, why is there a necessity to pass on those genes?

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** Many genetic diseases can already be avoided through technology nowadays. Many humans today definitely wouldn't survive in primitive society because they couldn't adapt. In primitive society, physical combat power was definitely very important.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Yeah, my point is, can human cloning technology solve medical problems like some other technologies do?

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** What kind of medical problems? The only use for clones I can think of right now is to satisfy the special tastes of certain people. The reason the cloning issue isn't as severe as the homosexuality issue is that the demand isn't high, no one is advocating for it... Where there is no demand, there is no market. The few who do have the demand will either take illegal routes or rely on fantasies.

&emsp;&emsp;**Chenji:** Exactly, plus homosexuals are an already existing group, while clones do not yet exist.

&emsp;&emsp;**Yamu:** What kind of person needs to clone themselves? One kind is for conducting experiments, the other is out of extreme narcissism. The difficult thing to understand about the latter is that very few people are so narcissistic. First, the losers have no resonance with this because they are not outstanding enough; they hope to have children with more outstanding people. And those who are a bit narcissistic because of their own excellence can always find someone even more excellent than themselves, so they are not yet at the point of wanting to clone themselves as children. When some people imagine the outstanding but lonely individuals of the past, they always imagine them as being too lonely, such as single philosophers like Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. In fact, these people also had friends in their lives. A person must be incredibly narcissistic, lonely, eager to be understood, and eager for others to love them just as they love themselves in order to want to clone themselves. Therefore, those who truly want to clone themselves out of narcissism are just too few...

&emsp;&emsp;The manifestations of narcissism also vary. One type of narcissism is believing oneself to be awesome, outstanding, and capable, able to make others adore and admire them, and able to conquer others. If they met another version of themselves in the world, both would be full of hostility towards each other. Another type is pitying and doting on oneself, longing for someone else to love them as they love themselves. This kind of narcissism is lonely; if they are full of charm, they will fall in love with the other version of themselves in the world. Narcissists with homosexual tendencies have a stronger motive to clone themselves because they are less likely to develop a sense of competition towards their clone and more likely to show feelings of adoration...
