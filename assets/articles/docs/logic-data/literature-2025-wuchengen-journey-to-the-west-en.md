_(This article is an answer to the Zhihu question "How would Wu Cheng'en view the setting of Sun Wukong and the White Bone Demon falling in love?")_

&emsp;&emsp;To infer how Wu Cheng'en would view this issue, we must deeply understand Wu Cheng'en's aesthetic preferences and his design regarding Sun Wukong's preferences in making friends. I will discuss this issue in detail below.

**Wu Cheng'en's View on Friendship May Have Influenced His Depiction of Sun Wukong's View on Friendship**

&emsp;&emsp;Compared to the image of Sun Wukong in earlier Journey to the West stories and those in later generations, the Sun Wukong in the Ming Dynasty 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_ has two notable differences:

1. In the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_, Sun Wukong is a highly multi-dimensional and rich character. He is naturally gifted and deeply learned (for example, in Chapter 68, he demonstrates medical talent). He also has rich emotions; he loves to laugh and also cries. The novel describes Sun Wukong crying over twenty times. In previous _Journey to the West_ stories, Sun Wukong was not such an emotionally rich figure. In contemporary _Journey to the West_ adaptations, Sun Wukong is also often portrayed as someone who does not shed tears lightly. For instance, in the widely known 1986 TV series _Journey to the West_, Sun Wukong rarely cries. In the novel _Wukong Biography_ (_Wukong Zhuan_), Sun Wukong's personality is even more one-dimensional; in that novel, he never cries even once.
    
2. An elitist view on friendship. We can discern Sun Wukong's taste in making friends from his attitude towards different people.

&emsp;&emsp;Zhu Bajie: Sun Wukong often holds a mocking posture towards Zhu Bajie. "Idiot" and "lout" are his common terms of address for Bajie. Although it cannot be said there is malicious intent, he is quite disgusted by Zhu Bajie. Apart from mocking Bajie's dullness, he is also often dissatisfied with Bajie's gluttony, laziness, and lustfulness. Whenever Zhu Bajie blindly acts out of lust, Sun Wukong always loses his patience and teaches him a lesson. For example, in Chapter 95, there is the following description: "The Pilgrim stepped forward, grabbed Bajie, slapped him twice, and scolded: 'You village lout! What kind of place is this, that you dare to arouse your lustful mind!'"

&emsp;&emsp;Zhenyuanzi: Zhenyuanzi is an original character in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_. Zhenyuanzi is the master of the Wuzhuang Daoist Temple on Longevity Mountain, the ancestor of Earth Immortals. He does not worship the Three Purities nor kneel to the Four Sovereigns, claiming to be "coeval with the world." He can be considered an extremely aloof person. Yet, he showed great appreciation and tolerance for Sun Wukong, who wreaked havoc in his temple. To Sun Wukong, who pushed over the Ginseng Fruit Tree, he gave a way out. After Sun Wukong invited Guanyin to heal the Ginseng Fruit Tree, Zhenyuanzi completely forgave him, and a deep friendship quickly developed between them. The original text describes it this way: "That Zhenyuanzi and the Pilgrim became sworn brothers. The two hit it off perfectly and absolutely refused to let go; he arranged banquets and entertained them, and they stayed for five or six days in a row. Since the elder (Tang Sanzang) took the Grass-Returning Pill (Ginseng fruit), he truly seemed reborn, his spirit refreshed and body healthy. He was eager to fetch the scriptures and unwilling to delay, so having no other choice, they set off." From the description, we can see that Zhenyuanzi and Sun Wukong shared the same ideals, thoroughly understood each other, and were very attached to one another. The deep friendship between Zhenyuanzi and Sun Wukong is the most romantic and heartwarming emotional relationship Wukong obtained in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_. Why did Zhenyuanzi and Sun Wukong hit it off so perfectly? It might be explained this way: they are both incredibly talented and proud. Zhenyuanzi does not worship the Three Purities nor kneel to the Four Sovereigns; he is outside the Heavenly Court's system, a relatively independent immortal. Wukong also has little respect for the upper echelon of the immortal realm. At the same time, they are both extremely powerful, giving them plenty of common ground in discussing Daoist magic. Therefore, they greatly appreciate each other's talents and character. On the other hand, Zhenyuanzi has a beautiful appearance, exquisite clothing, a transcendent immortal demeanor, and an elegant temperament, making him pleasing to the eye. This might have also increased Wukong's attachment to him. Authors generally care a lot about portraying characters who have a good relationship with the protagonist because they tend to project their own tastes onto such characters. Wukong knows many immortals; why did he only hit it off perfectly with Zhenyuanzi? "Hitting it off perfectly" implies harmonious thoughts and mutual understanding. Both Zhenyuanzi and Wukong are powerful individuals wandering outside the system. They probably both feel a certain detachment from the system, whereas other powerful immortals mostly mingle within the system, lacking common language with Wukong in this regard. Furthermore, Zhenyuanzi highly appreciates Wukong. The original text says: "Then that Great Immortal Zhenyuan took the Pilgrim by the hand and said, 'I also know your abilities, and I have heard of your heroic name...'" This Zhenyuanzi is quite forward; they were just fighting, and suddenly he grabs Sun Wukong by the hand, supporting him, and praising his abilities and name. The prerequisite for getting a friendly response from Sun Wukong is appreciating him, but absolutely not seducing him. Sun Wukong completely looks down on those female demons who try to seduce him. This is probably because Wukong believes his own abilities and talents are what matter and deserve appreciation. Those female demons try to seduce everyone they see, not recognizing him as special, nor seeing the qualities in him that truly deserve attention. Zhenyuanzi is highly skilled and simultaneously aloof with standards higher than the sky. His appreciation and attachment to Wukong largely satisfied Wukong's self-esteem. Furthermore, Zhenyuanzi, like Wukong, disdains attaching himself to authority, which means they share similar values or even political views, a very important factor in an emotional relationship.

&emsp;&emsp;Erlang Shen: The tit-for-tat dynamic between Erlang Shen and Sun Wukong is widely known, thanks to various classic texts and film/television adaptations depicting their brilliant rivalry. However, the plot describing Erlang Shen and Sun Wukong's friendly relations in Chapter 63 of the Ming 100-chapter version is less well-known. In the novel, they first meet in Chapter 6, where Erlang Shen appears as Sun Wukong's pursuer. This chapter describes Erlang Shen's image: appearing young and handsome, dressed exquisitely and elegantly. Sun Wukong initially underestimated the strength of this young gentleman. Subsequently, the two fought magic for three hundred rounds without a clear victor, truly a match of equals. Eventually, with the help of Taishang Laojun, Erlang Shen successfully arrested Sun Wukong. In Chapter 63, they meet for the second time. Here, Sun Wukong's attitude towards Erlang Shen undergoes a rather abrupt change. He shows unusual respect for Erlang Shen, reflected in his terms of address ("Manifested Saint Big Brother," "Elder Brother") and attitude (using respectful, cautious, and elegant words). Furthermore, regarding the matter of "paying respects" to Erlang Shen, Sun Wukong showed a rare sense of embarrassment, saying, "But the Manifested Saint Big Brother is inside; I was once subdued by him, it's awkward for me to see him." He then asked Zhu Bajie to go stop Erlang Shen. Additionally, Sun Wukong said to Erlang Shen, who had never done him a favor: "I previously received a great grace from you, but have yet to repay it even for a moment." Upon meeting Erlang Shen, the two "held hands and supported each other." They were just fighting last time, and now they are "holding hands"? The speed at which this friendship developed catches people off guard. In Chapter 63, Erlang Shen is extremely happy to see Sun Wukong, and the brothers drink under the stars and moon, spending a beautiful night together: "The brothers sat on the ground under the open sky and the light of the stars and moon, raising their cups to catch up on old times. Truly, the lonely night feels long, but the night of joy is short; before they knew it, the east was growing pale." From Chapter 63, we can see that the usually untamed and arrogant Sun Wukong showed rare appreciation and respect for Erlang Shen, who had once defeated him. The two seem to have a deep mutual appreciation. Because Sun Wukong is the protagonist of _Journey to the West_ and is famous for being untamed, many readers are used to seeing his strong, combative side. When he shows respect and humility, many readers find it strange (thinking: "I still prefer your untamed look!"). When Wu Cheng'en was writing, he might have had a thought like this: "Erlang Shen is a character I quite like (Wu Cheng'en wrote the _Song of Erlang Searching the Mountain_, where Erlang Shen is clearly a positive figure), and Sun Wukong is the protagonist under my pen. Erlang Shen should also be the type Sun Wukong appreciates (authors easily bestow their own tastes upon their protagonists). Let them be friends, let them hold hands. Look, their friendship is quite beautiful (and based on the original description, it is indeed beautiful)!"

&emsp;&emsp;In summary, Sun Wukong appreciates those with peerless talent, prominent status, aloof personality, handsome appearance, and high aesthetic taste (reflected in exquisite clothing), and he holds negative views on traits like lust, laziness, and stupidity. In _Journey to the West_, the author frequently refers to Bajie directly as "idiot" (Bajie: Do I not need face?), showing that the author's personal impression of Bajie is also quite poor. We can see that both Zhenyuanzi and Erlang Shen are stronger than Wukong, but both highly appreciate him, which seems to be a necessary condition to become Wukong's good friend. Sun Wukong's high standards in making friends can explain why, in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_, he has no wife and seemingly no sexual experience (In Chapter 23, Sun Wukong's statement, "Since I was little, I haven't known how to do that sort of thing; let Bajie stay here," might imply he has no sexual experience, but Wukong clearly understands the affairs between men and women. In Chapter 27, he teases Xuanzang: "Master, I know you now. Seeing her looks like that, you must have felt worldly desires. If you really have this intention, let Bajie chop down some trees, Sha Monk find some grass, and I will be the carpenter to build a hut right here. You can consummate the marriage with her, and we can all disband. Wouldn't that be a deed? Why bother trudging along to fetch some scriptures!"). In the Ming 100-chapter version, Wukong is a person of rich emotions. He feels sad when Xuanzang is captured, and he is deeply attached to his confidant Zhenyuanzi. All this proves he is not a person without emotional needs. So why does Sun Wukong have no girlfriend or wife? Over his long life as the famous Demon King of Flower Fruit Mountain, there must have been many demons trying to curry favor with him. But his standards were too high; he looked down on those demons (low skills, no prominent background or status, no noble character, and usually low attractiveness), so he had no interest in romance or marriage. Wukong seems to have a special soft spot for the traits of being "powerful (able to defeat him)" and "arrogant and aloof." The "arrogant and aloof" trait Wukong prefers is not the narcissistic personality disorder of someone who lacks self-awareness yet thinks highly of themselves, nor the crude arrogance of a hooligan bullying the weak. It is the external manifestation of the self-esteem of a powerful person and an attitude of disdaining to attach oneself to authority. This is exactly the kind of arrogance and aloofness Erlang Shen and Zhenyuanzi possess.

&emsp;&emsp;If we look back at Wu Cheng'en's life experience, we can find that Sun Wukong's view on friendship is similar to Wu Cheng'en's. Wu Cheng'en was extremely intelligent. The _Epilogue to the Surviving Manuscripts of Mr. Sheyang_ describes his past as a child prodigy: "In his childhood, he was already famous in Huai for his writings." As a child prodigy, Wu Cheng'en was appreciated by many social elites from a young age. For example, the famous litterateur Zhu Yingdeng highly appreciated Wu Cheng'en; his affection for Wu Cheng'en was described as "loving him like his own son." Out of his fondness for Wu Cheng'en, he even gave half of his family's book collection to Wu Cheng'en. Zhu Yingdeng's son, Zhu Yuefan, became Wu Cheng'en's close friend. Zhu Yuefan was slightly older than Wu Cheng'en (Zhu Yuefan born around 1501, Wu Cheng'en born in 1506). He was a Jinshi of the Jiachen year of the 23rd year of Jiajing (1544), later appointed Magistrate of Wucheng County in Zhejiang, served as Principal in the Nanjing Ministry of Revenue, Vice Director in the Ministry of War, Director of the Bureau of Receptions in the Ministry of Rites, and went out to be the Prefect of Jiujiang Prefecture in Jiangxi. (Shepo is the ancient name for Sheyang Lake. Zhu Yuefan's courtesy name was Shepo; could it be that he discussed and chose this name together with Wu Cheng'en?)

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en's poem given to Zhu Yuefan, _Zeng Zijia_ (_To Zijia_), demonstrates his fondness for Zhu Yuefan and his praise for Zhu Yuefan's talent:

> I love Zhu Lang, seed of dragons and phoenixes,
> Your poetic grace now rivals Liu Zhen and Cao Zhi.
> A jade whip and purple aura highlight your character,
> Spring clouds in the golden hall illuminate your feathers.
> Your peerless, soaring spirit is yet unknown to the world,
> How lofty is your path of scholarly refinement.
> I throw to you an ode of the three mystical islands on the sea,
> And you repay me with a five-colored robe from among the flowers.

&emsp;&emsp;Su Xing's _Chronicle of Wu Cheng'en's Life_ suggests that this poem actually contains Wu Cheng'en's resentful response to Zhu Yuefan's criticism of him neglecting his proper duties (not studying hard for the imperial examinations and instead writing supernatural novels all day). However, having read it repeatedly, I don't see any sign of complaint in this poem—at least not on the surface. To think Wu Cheng'en is complaining that Zhu Yuefan doesn't understand him can only be seen as one possible interpretation. If Wu Cheng'en did intend to complain but wrote a poem like this, it would be rather bizarre. The first three couplets of the poem express Wu Cheng'en's deep affection and high praise for Zhu Yuefan. How could the last line suddenly turn into a complaint? Such a transition makes no sense and defies normal writing habits. If the last line is a complaint, then the first three lines appear sarcastic and hypocritical. If you were to write a poem, you would find this rhythm extremely uncomfortable, because such an abrupt turn would disrupt the poem's internal logic and ruin its aesthetic appeal. Moreover, if Wu Cheng'en were dissatisfied, he wouldn't be in a good mood. In a bad mood, how could he write the first three couplets full of positive emotions? If he were disgruntled, his affection for Zhu Yuefan would diminish, making it agonizing to write "I love Zhu Lang."

&emsp;&emsp;A direct translation of this poem is roughly as follows:

&emsp;&emsp;I admire your innately exceptional talent, Zhu Lang, outstanding like the child of a dragon and phoenix.

&emsp;&emsp;Today, your poetic attainments can almost rival those of Liu Zhen and Cao Zhi.

&emsp;&emsp;Holding a jade whip and draped in purple aura, you show true strength of character; spring clouds in the golden hall reflect upon your feathers.

&emsp;&emsp;The world has not yet recognized your peerless, brilliant presence, and how noble is your path of cultivated elegance.

&emsp;&emsp;I give you the Ode of the Three Mountains on the Sea, and you return to me a five-colored robe from the flowers. (Alternative meaning: I gave you the Ode... how could you repay me with a five-colored robe?)

&emsp;&emsp;Whether Wu Cheng'en was complaining depends on the meaning of the "five-colored robe." If it refers to official attire, it might imply Zhu Yuefan was urging Wu Cheng'en to become an official. But perhaps the five-colored robe doesn't mean that here, but is simply a description of something positive and beautiful. In the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_, five colors appear many times, all as positive descriptive words indicating beautiful colors and auspiciousness, such as "auspicious five-colored light," "five-colored rosy clouds," and "five-colored auspicious clouds." Therefore, it's entirely possible that "I throw to you an ode... And you repay me with a five-colored robe" means Wu Cheng'en and Zhu Yuefan were exchanging gifts to show mutual affection and respect (like the idiom "returning a plum for a peach"). Perhaps Zhu Yuefan indeed gave Wu Cheng'en beautiful clothes. The Zhu family was much wealthier than the Wu family. Since they had already gifted a massive collection of books, wouldn't gifting some clothes be unsurprising? _Zeng Zijia_ seems to reveal Wu Cheng'en's degree of sapiosexuality. The poem details the traits Wu Cheng'en admired in Zhu Yuefan, including: rare natural talent (or prominent background), peerless brilliance, a pure and independent personality ("character" [fenggu] might refer to the Jian'an character), an elegant temperament, and noble moral sentiments. Obviously, Zhu Yuefan's outstanding talent and pure character inspired his affection and desire to create. He used a series of beautiful words to describe Zhu Yuefan's wonderful image, making their friendship appear deeply romantic and touching. Comparing Wu Cheng'en's other presentation poems, we can find that the strong, direct personal emotion shown in _Zeng Zijia_ (using an intimate term like "Zhu Lang," directly expressing "I love Zhu Lang," and passionately praising his talent) is quite unique. Here are a few examples of his other poems.

&emsp;&emsp;_To Historian Li Shilu_ (To Li Chunfang):

> Strolling high in Yingzhou, a gathering of immortals,
> Attaining the Dao has always had its lineages.
> Your name tops the golden list of Grade A candidates,
> In the spring hall, generations of colorful phoenixes connect.
> Moving home, ancient records of Huayang Cave,
> Opening the library, newly turning the Taiyi scrolls.
> Together we promise to embellish imperial plans,
> The colored brush shines brightly in the smoke of the Jade Capital.

&emsp;&emsp;_To Shen Shizhou_ (To Shen Kun):

> In the east wind, morning horses scatter ringing jade,
> The clear light of the North Pole bands the Jade River.
> At Hanshi, palace eunuchs pass painted candles,
> In spring garments, attending officials hold fragrant silk.
> After snow in Penglai, fireworks fill the air,
> At the gates of heaven, the Emperor's rain and dew are abundant.
> Grinding ink every morning to supply the inkstone drops,
> Newly green at the Phoenix Pool, drinking in waves of grace.

&emsp;&emsp;We can see that in these two poems given to Li Chunfang and Shen Kun, Wu Cheng'en used much more formal and polite expressions, lacking direct intimate addresses and strong outbursts of personal emotion.

Wu Cheng'en has a poem titled _In a Guest Window in Jinling Facing the Snow, Teasing Zhu Cicao_:

> I dreamed I rode backwards on a silver-scaled dragon,
> At midnight riding clouds up to the heavenly gates.
> Looking down at the Starry River, frozen into stone,
> Swept up by the wind and scattered into dust.
> With a sudden long howl, the handle of the Dipper shakes,
> On both banks, elm leaves fall in profusion.
> Immortal maidens ride side-by-side on white phoenixes,
> Looking at me warmly, gifting me jade rings.
> Waking up, I open the door and look up at the sky,
> Clapping my hands and crying out how absolutely bizarre.
> Heaven and Earth, inside and out, are all one color,
> I only see plum blossoms striking the fragrant moon.
> Wildly I spread a deerskin and sit shielded by flowers,
> Blowing a long tune on a flute of ancient iron.
> An old crane flies over and calls towards me,
> Looking at its shadow, dancing lightly, flickering in and out of sight.
> At this time, my body is in a realm of crystal,
> My liver and gall stand tall, sharing the clear purity.
> I call a boy and ask, what is this thing?
> The boy, ignorant, forcibly calls it snow.
> You, old official of the Sacrifices Bureau, in the estate across the bridge,
> Your breath blowing pearls, hanging on cold bristles.
> Draped in books, shrinking your neck, reading by the window,
> Your voice mingling with hungry crows in a whimpering chorus.
> The tea is fragrant, the wine is beautiful; if you would but come,
> On the clustered fire, the water in the copper pitcher is just hot.

&emsp;&emsp;Scholars believe this poem was written to Zhu Yuefan; the title indicates it's meant to tease him. It describes Wu Cheng'en having a beautiful dream about the Heavenly Court, even dreaming of riding phoenixes with immortal maidens who gifted him jade rings. Waking up, he thinks of Zhu Yuefan studying hard at home in the dead of winter, calling out to him to stop reading and hurry over to his house to drink with him. We can see the poem's content is relaxed, cheerful, and humorous. This poem also shows that Zhu Yuefan and Wu Cheng'en were very close, allowing them to joke casually.

&emsp;&emsp;Zhu Yuefan has a poem for Wu Cheng'en, _Zeng Wu Ruzhong_ (_To Wu Ruzhong_):

> Before our eyes, worldly affairs are chaotic day by day,
> Outside of material things, my heart's expectation rests solely on you.
> I am most pleased that our longing knows no distant roads,
> Just through appreciating your marvelous writings.
> Returning in spring to study in the garden amidst fragrant grass,
> Snow presses on the Huai River waves, rolling into evening clouds.
> Treasure your great talent to act in an auspicious world,
> A young man should randomly compare himself to Zhong Jun.

&emsp;&emsp;(Some versions online have slight character differences; I am using the version from the _Shandai Ge Collection_ published by Zhu Shiyan in 1835).

&emsp;&emsp;The first two lines of Zhu Yuefan's poem are easy to understand, meaning roughly:

&emsp;&emsp;Before my eyes, worldly affairs are chaotic day by day, and only you share my heart's sentiments in a realm beyond material things.

What pleases me most is that our mutual longing is not hindered by distance, precisely because I can appreciate your marvelous writings.

&emsp;&emsp;"Returning in spring to study in the garden amidst fragrant grass, / Snow presses on the Huai River waves, rolling into evening clouds" is quite abstract, possibly referring to the two of them treading on spring grass in a garden or admiring the winter snowscape over the Huai River. If we insist Zhu Yuefan might be criticizing Wu Cheng'en in this poem, perhaps "Treasure your great talent to act in an auspicious world, / A young man should randomly (perhaps meaning 'freely' or 'carelessly') compare himself to Zhong Jun" carries that meaning. Zhong Jun was a child prodigy who died young. By mentioning Zhong Jun, Zhu Yuefan might be hoping Wu Cheng'en doesn't waste his talent and should contribute more to society. However, this poem could have another meaning: Wu Cheng'en is feeling dejected over his frustrated official career, and Zhu Yuefan is encouraging him, saying his talent will not die young like Zhong Jun's (while simultaneously praising Wu Cheng'en's talent as comparable to Zhong Jun's), encouraging him to be more confident and value his own talent. Why is this interpretation possible? Because Wu Cheng'en sometimes showed a lack of confidence. For example, in his _Elegy for Mr. Zhishan_, he described his self-doubt: "I, Cheng'en, am a petty scholar of Huaihai, impractical and rambling, uncounted among the people of this age, yet you graced me with your recognition; trapped in mud and poverty, met with endless ridicule, your belief in me was greater than my own belief in myself."

&emsp;&emsp;Interpreted this way, "Treasure your great talent to act in an auspicious world, A young man should randomly compare himself to Zhong Jun" and "Your peerless, soaring spirit is yet unknown to the world, / How lofty is your path of scholarly refinement" become mutually encouraging statements. Perhaps Wu Cheng'en felt Zhu Yuefan's outstanding talent wasn't sufficiently appreciated by the world, yet he understood and adored Zhu Yuefan's talent and character; meanwhile, Zhu Yuefan felt Wu Cheng'en's abilities were overlooked by the world, leading to their mutual appreciation. This logic flows much better. Why would people who cannot understand each other mutually praise and long for one another? Moreover, _Zeng Zijia_ and _Zeng Wu Ruzhong_ do not necessarily refer to the same event. It is hard to say whether "Just through appreciating your marvelous writings" and "I throw to you an ode of the three mystical islands on the sea" are referring to the same exchange. If Wu Cheng'en always had the habit of showing his writings to Zhu Yuefan, these two poems might just be two preserved out of many exchanges. Furthermore, Zhu Yuefan very likely had a habit of gifting supplies to the impoverished Wu Cheng'en. Perhaps _Zeng Zijia_ was written on an occasion when Wu Cheng'en, after giving a work to Zhu Yuefan, received gifted supplies in return; overjoyed, thinking of all Zhu Yuefan's virtues, and feeling he truly loved Zhu Yuefan, he wrote this poem in return. If we don't force an extremely awkward "complaint theory" interpretation, we find the overall atmosphere of _Zeng Zijia_ is full of positive, joyful emotion. It’s entirely possible Wu Cheng'en was extremely happy when writing "I throw to you an ode... And you repay me with a five-colored robe." He might have been thinking: "We are exchanging gifts, our relationship is truly great, Zhu Lang, I really love you!"

&emsp;&emsp;(Speaking of this, I am reminded of a close friend of mine whose IQ was over 165 in her youth. She was considered a child prodigy, but later fell into hardship due to psychological flaws. I also often send her supplies.)

&emsp;&emsp;After reading a large number of Zhu Yuefan's poems, I understand why Wang Shizhen's _Yiyuan Zhiyan_ described him as "like a Daoist master on a high seat, suddenly speaking in a foreign tongue" (meaning Zhu Yuefan is like an elevated Daoist who suddenly spouts gibberish). He truly loves dropping obscure classical references, making his poetic meaning hard to decipher.

&emsp;&emsp;They were friends for many years and must have understood each other very well. While the possibility of writing poems to sarcastically mock each other exists, if their ideals clashed, they could have reasoned it out or spoken their minds directly. Why first express fondness and praise, and then start complaining? All in all, interpretations of their friendship should maintain a multi-angle perspective.

&emsp;&emsp;The poem _Zeng Zijia_ reminds me of the description of Zhenyuanzi in _Journey to the West_: "The Great Immortal dodged sideways, stepped onto an auspicious light, and went straight up into the air. The Pilgrim also mounted the clouds and quickly chased after him. The Great Immortal revealed his true form in mid-air. Look at his attire:

&emsp;&emsp;Wearing a purple gold crown, donning a care-free crane cloak. Treading in shoes on his feet, a silk sash tied around his waist. A body like a youth's, a face like a beauty's. Three strands of beard floating below his chin, raven feathers layered at his temples. He came to meet the Pilgrim with no weapon, only twirling a jade whisk in his hand." The commonality between the two descriptions is the appearance of purple, gold, feathers, and jade objects (moreover, Zhenyuanzi also has a whip and used it to whip Sun Wukong, and Zhenyuanzi's name contains "zi"). Since Wu Cheng'en described these images in a presentation poem to an admired friend, he must have considered these images beautiful. The line "Your peerless, soaring spirit is yet unknown to the world, / How lofty is your path of scholarly refinement" is also fitting to describe Zhenyuanzi. Zhenyuanzi is an extraordinary master transcending the world, elegant and generous, with profound magical power.

&emsp;&emsp;Interestingly, Zhu Yuefan also seemed quite interested in immortality. The _Shandai Ge Collection_ (Volume 23) contains the following record:

> Sleeping in a rich man's hundred-foot high building,
> Sleeping in a poor man's eight-foot hut is also sleep.
> In life, one randomly makes a thousand-year plan,
> But in the end, everyone will sleep under the open sky in the dew.
> In times of chaos, declining sideburns turn fluffy,
> A wisp of strong wind dances with the white dragon.
> I wish to ride it to ask the Queen Mother,
> In the Penglai mountains, what place can accommodate me?

> _Mocking Bo Zhizi_
> Three years without seeing Xu Wugui,
> Moving the fire stealthily, the Great Medicine is formed.
> The brothers sitting together are almost drawn out,
> White-headed, facing each other, talking of immortality.

> _Poem of Feelings at the Thatched Cottage_:
> At the clear pool, one might realize the Arhat state,
> The setting sun still hangs over the Stupa.
> Just saying the red shield is enough to lean on a table,
> Who would have expected weapons to suddenly clash on bare ground.
> The Daoist should remember the alchemy furnace,
> The boy still seeks the water-filtering silk.
> At the end of his road, Ruan Ji truly has no recourse.
> The bamboo in the forest is green, but what can it do against the rain?

&emsp;&emsp;Judging from the contents of the _Shandai Ge Collection_, Zhu Yuefan was quite interested in Daoism and stories of gods and demons. He and Wu Cheng'en must have had a lot of common ground. In _Journey to the West_, Wukong fears death. In Chapter 1, he begins to cry:

> One day, while enjoying a banquet with the monkeys, he suddenly felt sorrowful and shed tears. The monkeys hurriedly bowed and asked, "Great King, why are you troubled?" The Monkey King said, "Though I am joyful now, I have a slight long-term worry, hence my trouble." The monkeys laughed, "Great King, you are too insatiable! We gather joyfully every day in this blessed land of immortal mountains, the divine continent of ancient caves. We are not governed by the Qilin, not controlled by the Phoenix, and not restricted by human kings. We are utterly free, possessing boundless blessings. Why worry about the distant future?" The Monkey King said, "Though we are not subject to human laws today, nor fear the majesty of beasts, in the future when we are old and our blood decays, the old Lord of Yama secretly controls us. Once we die, wouldn't we have lived in this world in vain, unable to reside forever among the heavenly beings?"

&emsp;&emsp;Wukong is very interested in immortality, and Zhenyuanzi is a character deeply tied to the arts of immortality. If Zhu Yuefan lived today, he would definitely be an anti-aging technology enthusiast (Ahem, truly a kindred spirit of mine!).

&emsp;&emsp;Speaking of using ambiguous language in presentation poems to friends, one must mention an anecdote about Zhu Yingdeng recorded in the _Yaoshan Tang Waiji_: "When Zhu Lingxi was the Education Commissioner of Shaanxi, he went to Jingyang to inspect essays and had a homosexual intimacy (Longyang xia) with a scholar. Before leaving, Zhu gifted him a poem: 'Wanting to bloom but not blooming, flowers fill the branches; wanting to leave but not leaving, I have someone on my mind. The one on my mind is on the Jing river islet; spring wind blows golden orioles across the trees.' Later, he was eventually dismissed from office because of this." (The poem Zhu Yingdeng wrote to his rumored boyfriend is much more reserved in wording than the poem Wu Cheng'en wrote to Zhu Yuefan...)

&emsp;&emsp;In a farewell poem Zhu Yingdeng wrote to his friend Gu Lin, he also expressed gratitude for the bond of a confidant: "You came from the capital, asking me the way to Cangzhou. Briefly staying in Huainan, lingering by the osmanthus tree. The round canopy of the osmanthus shades the Chu palace; when autumn comes, every tree raises a fragrant wind. The returning carriage stops at dusk on the golden road, the precious sword at the door unleashes a jade rainbow. The host hears the guest has arrived and smiles all day. The plates hold interwoven alfalfa stalks, the urn holds amber nectar of jade juice. The clouds and waters of the Five Lakes return without dust, suspecting it is snow falling back on Shanyin. Unrestrained, we often drink like the Heshuo crowd; elegant and romantic, reconnecting with Jian'an talents. Evening after evening, opening the windows to the jade mats. I know not where this soaring spirit comes from, but sitting here makes deep sorrow vanish before you. In my life, I have not heard the Dao, and at forty I have already returned to the fields. How could I bow my waist and think of cutting off my grain; flipping over the injured feathers, hating the startling bowstring. The clearing of the Yellow River cannot be waited for; the world views me as ordinary. My fishing rod is not rigged to swallow a boat-swallowing fish; in discussing friendships of the past, who was right? Moved by your heart, steadfast as a mountain, caring for me without shifting. Seeing you off on the rivers and seas, regretting I cannot follow you. If you have the mood for Mount Tiantai in the future, perhaps send me a poem of Xinggong." We can see from this poem that Zhu Yingdeng was deeply distressed about not being understood, and Gu Dongqiao, as another genius, provided Zhu Yingdeng with immense psychological comfort because he understood him.

&emsp;&emsp;The _History of Ming, Biographies, Volume 174_ describes the reason for Zhu Yingdeng's dismissal as: "Relying on his talent and acting arrogantly, hit by flying rumors, dismissed and returned home." What flying rumors hit Zhu Yingdeng? Were they rumors of homosexuality? Did he resign voluntarily or was he passively dismissed? As time has passed, it is no longer known. But judging from Zhu Yingdeng's generous treatment of Wu Cheng'en, we can see he showed unusual enthusiasm for talented scholars. Based on his behavior, he might have been a sapiosexual. I propose a reasonable guess here: Zhu Yingdeng might have had a platonic romance with a certain scholar, but it was rumored to be "homosexual intimacy" (Longyang xia). Zhu Yingdeng felt misunderstood and vulgarized, and unwilling to endure the rumors, he resigned and returned to the fields. Of course, it cannot be ruled out that Jiang Yikui's record of Zhu Yingdeng in the _Yaoshan Tang Waiji_ is purely unfounded gossip.

&emsp;&emsp;Sapiosexuality comes in varying degrees and can exist independently of one's innate sexual orientation. For some people, gender is the primary factor in choosing a mate, while intellect is an important factor. But for those with a strong preference for intellect, this preference can override their innate emotional/sexual orientation. How does this happen? Here are some possible mechanisms:

&emsp;&emsp;So-called intelligence or intellect is reflected in whether one has good logical thinking abilities and profound knowledge. If a person values logical thinking highly (which usually means they themselves have good logical thinking, because if they don't, they cannot discern whether others do, and thus cannot select potential friends or mates based on it) and is interested in knowledge, they are more easily attracted to an intellectual person. Emotional/sexual orientation involves being attracted to specific types of people. This attraction includes a series of neural activity changes that bring positive, joyful feelings. Therefore, when attracted to someone, we want more conversation and contact with them. The degree of positive emotion generated relates to the excitement threshold. If we are frequently stimulated by something that brings us joy, our sensitivity to it decreases. If a sapiosexual's preferred intellect is rare, they rarely meet people who satisfy their preference. When they do meet such a person, because they are rarely stimulated, their threshold is very low, and the positive feelings this person brings can be very intense. These intense positive feelings might exceed the positive feelings brought by someone who fits their innate emotional/sexual orientation. At this point, they might realize their innate emotional/sexual orientation is not important. Therefore, the situation where a preference for intellect overrides innate emotional/sexual orientation sometimes occurs in individuals with an extremely high preference for intellect. If the sapiosexual themselves is very smart and possesses strong reflective abilities, this is even more likely, because they will reflect on their instincts (innate emotional/sexual orientation) and weaken their effect. This is very rare, and most people don't reflect on whether their sexual orientation should change based on reason. Although there are no relevant academic studies (this psychology is too subtle, with few samples, and probably few psychologists would think of such a topic), through reflection causing a change in emotional/sexual orientation has indeed happened to me and my friends.

&emsp;&emsp;It is worth noting that "love" (ai) in the Ming Dynasty carried the same meaning as it does today. In Chapter 27 of _Journey to the West_ ("The Corpse Demon Tricks Tang Sanzang Three Times / The Holy Monk Angrily Banishes the Handsome Monkey King"), Wukong says to Tang Seng (possibly coaxing/tricking him): "Master, how would you know. When Old Sun was a demon king in the Water Curtain Cave, if I wanted to eat human flesh, this is what I'd do: I would turn into gold and silver, or an estate, or a drunkard, or female beauty. For those infatuated fools who fell in love with me, I would lure them into the cave and do as I pleased, steaming or boiling them for enjoyment; if I couldn't finish eating them, I'd dry them in the sun for cloudy days! Master, if I had arrived later, you would have definitely fallen into her trap and met her poisonous hands!" Regardless of what kind of love Wu Cheng'en meant by "I love Zhu Lang," when readers read it, out of instinct, they inevitably think along certain lines. That Wu Cheng'en dared to write this shows that his relationship with Zhu Yuefan was exceptionally deep, and he completely didn't care how Zhu Yuefan would view the meaning of "I love." Moreover, he clearly didn't mind later generations seeing this poem (I think the possibility that readers reading this poem would interpret its purpose as complaining is far lower than the possibility of interpreting it as an expression of affection and admiration for Zhu Yuefan). Of course, my main point here is to show that they had a deep and close relationship, but this does not mean Wu Cheng'en's feelings for his wife and for Zhu Yuefan were identical.

&emsp;&emsp;In Chapter 23 of _Journey to the West_, there is a poem titled _Xi Jiang Yue: Lust is a Sword that Harms the Body_:

> Lust is a sword that harms the body; greedy for it, you will surely meet disaster.
> A beautiful girl of sixteen, her makeup so fair, is fiercer and stronger than a Yaksha.
> You only have one original capital, and no small profits to add to your purse.
> Carefully hide away your capital; guard it firmly and do not let it go to waste.

&emsp;&emsp;(In the _Surviving Manuscripts of Mr. Sheyang_, there is a line: "The soft village of women may intoxicate, but you must remember the blade hanging above," which expresses the same meaning as "Lust is a sword over the head" as seen in _Xi Jiang Yue: Lust is a Sword that Harms the Body_).

&emsp;&emsp;Obviously, this poem reflects the author's disgust towards romance and lust between men and women, and the viewpoint is quite intense. A beautiful girl of sixteen is fiercer and stronger than a Yaksha? Good heavens, no matter the era, this view is quite exaggerated. Sun Wukong is deeply disgusted by lustful people (he taught Bajie many lessons because of this), has a strong resistance to the seductions of female demons, shows no attachment or fondness for any women, and pushes any opportunity for marriage or fake marriage onto Tang Seng and Bajie. He himself has zero desire to marry. In _Journey to the West_, there are indeed many beautiful women who appear as negative figures (man-eating female demons), which truly echoes the line "A beautiful girl of sixteen, her makeup so fair, is fiercer and stronger than a Yaksha." In the Yuan Dynasty _Zaju: Journey to the West_, Wukong loved women and had a wife. However, in the Ming 100-chapter version, Wukong suddenly completely avoids women. This is very likely related to the author's own aesthetic taste. Moreover, because the Ming 100-chapter version is so influential, the Sun Wukong inside who avoids women and has no wife causes many people to feel immense disgust at the idea of Sun Wukong falling in love.

&emsp;&emsp;Yet Wukong and Zhenyuanzi "hit it off perfectly and absolutely refused to let go." Because Wukong's feelings for Zhenyuanzi were harmonious and their minds connected, he was so attached to Zhenyuanzi he didn't even want to leave (Bajie also wanted to stay in Gao Village). Conversely, Tang Seng had no attachment to Zhenyuanzi, his friend from a past life, and was anxious to leave. Zhenyuanzi is an original character in the Ming 100-chapter version. Why did the author create a beautiful male immortal who becomes so intimate with Wukong, instead of a beautiful female fairy to befriend Sun Wukong? If Zhenyuanzi were gender-swapped, she would probably be universally recognized by readers as Sun Wukong's girlfriend (What place would there be for that White Bone Demon, who was smashed to pieces by Sun Wukong's staff?). Since it's all original creation, the author could write whatever he wanted. We see that whether in stories before Wu Cheng'en or contemporary _Journey to the West_ stories, authors love to arrange a wife/girlfriend for Sun Wukong rather than a male confidant (even the White Bone Demon is dragged in to make up the numbers; why not the Gold-Nosed White-Haired Mouse Demon? After all, the Mouse Demon explicitly tried to seduce Sun Wukong). If the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_ was indeed written by Wu Cheng'en, it shows Wu Cheng'en's aesthetic taste differed significantly from most male authors. Perhaps in Wu Cheng'en's mind, the mutual appreciation of a confidant bond between males was nobler and more beautiful than a male-female relationship based on lust, so he arranged Sun Wukong's emotional relationships according to his own concepts. "Hitting it off perfectly" (qingtou yihe) comes from _Journey to the West_, but in later generations, it is almost exclusively used to describe romantic love between a man and a woman, showing that readers also feel "hitting it off perfectly" has an ambiguous tone unsuitable for describing brotherhood. Adding "absolutely refusing to let go" makes it even more cloying. In the _Surviving Manuscripts of Mr. Sheyang_, there are also works describing romance between men and women. So why did Wu Cheng'en become so "stingy" in _Journey to the West_, refusing to give his protagonist Sun Wukong a girlfriend/wife? Perhaps because as Wu Cheng'en grew older, he reflected more on lust, increasingly feeling "lust is a sword over the head," and his heart turned more towards Buddhism (after all, he called himself Lay Buddhist Sheyang, and a lay Buddhist is someone practicing at home). Therefore, he was more inclined to mold a protagonist who avoided women.

&emsp;&emsp;Why didn't later authors arrange a gender-swapped Zhenyuanzi as Wukong's girlfriend? According to _Some people are attracted sexually to intelligence: A psychometric evaluation of sapiosexuality_, an IQ of ≈ 120 is rated as the most sexually attractive. For most people, a partner with an extremely high IQ (over 135) is not the most attractive intelligence level. Obviously, a gender-swapped Zhenyuanzi would not be attractive to most males and might even be an intimidating presence. Naturally, few authors prefer this type.

&emsp;&emsp;Zhu Yuefan has another poem known to be given to Wu Cheng'en, _Bie Ruzhong_ (_Parting from Ruzhong_):

> In the city's shade, holding hands, our feelings are sorrowful,
> On the water boat, the cloud light ripples on the white robe.
> Within the seas, you must cherish your own writings,
> Before my eyes, the bowls and basins, I am the first to escape.
> Yellow reeds, beating drums, mandarin ducks take flight,
> The Big Dipper, turning the boat, looking high through the battlements.
> Ever since the romantic Ji and Ruan dispersed,
> At Shanyang's empty society, wild weeds grow tall.

&emsp;&emsp;In this poem, Zhu Yuefan expresses his reluctance to part with Wu Cheng'en. "In the city's shade, holding hands, our feelings are sorrowful" probably means "By the city wall (during farewell), we hold each other's sleeves, our hearts filled with the sorrow and sadness of parting." It also expresses a nostalgia for the bygone days when literati friends gathered together. "Ever since the romantic Ji and Ruan dispersed, / At Shanyang's empty society, wild weeds grow tall" roughly means that since talented and romantic figures like Ji Kang and Ruan Ji dispersed, their old residences or gathering places in Shanyang (or referring to places where they once roamed) are left empty and overgrown with wild weeds (a scene of desolation).

&emsp;&emsp;In the _Shandai Ge Collection_, there is a poem _Viewing the Past in Huaiyin, Presented to Master Wu_, placed right before _Parting from Ruzhong_, which is highly likely also given to Wu Cheng'en:

> Stretching my neck, I gaze at the marshes and land,
> This place indeed overlooks a vital crossroads.
> A great nation is naturally esteemed in its essence,
> Its geography finds the perfect center.
> Twin cities with ninety thousand households,
> Just like the ancient capitals of Jia and Ru.
> The sun crow rises from the trees by the riverbank,
> Shooting red light toward Penglai.
> Tower ships hoist great flags,
> Beating drums east of the vast sea.
> Three islands roll up white clouds,
> A thousand miles arrayed with red rafters.
> The weather is cold, the great marsh is frozen,
> Strong wings beat against the high wind.
> In front, there is a mother washing silk,
> Right opposite the palace of the King of Han.
> Moved by this eternal sentiment,
> I entered the city and met with you.
> Arm in arm, we entered the wine tavern,
> Relaxed and unbridled like Lord Shan.
> Earnestly you drank my wine,
> Twin rings singing a tinkling melody.
> Singing to the Song of the Jade Pass,
> Laughing so hard it defeats all heroes.
> Tipping our cups, we suck up the Huai River,
> Making Mount Tongbo empty.
> The Big Dipper plunges into our jade mat,
> The frosty sky illuminates the lotus.
> Our hearts and livers laid bare all night long,
> Just as we are about to speak, we hear the morning bell.
> At dawn, hoisting the sail and departing,
> Heartbroken like a wild goose flying south.

&emsp;&emsp;From this poem, we can see Zhu Yuefan says he and Wu Cheng'en walked "arm in arm" into the wine tavern, indicating their relationship was extremely close.

Zhu Yuefan has a poem _Song Feeling the Magnolia_:

> Yesterday the magnolia bloomed, today the magnolia falls.
> The magnolia's floral chamber pierces high into the sky,
> Yet it mixes its red calyxes together with the lotus.
> The small mountain osmanthus tree still curves continuously,
> The Five Lakes lotus flowers are emptily graceful.
> Continuous and graceful, suiting the autumn sun,
> Sitting upright, solitary, nurturing the summoned gentleman's illness.
> High branches, cluster by cluster, gorgeous wooden lotuses,
> Dense leaves, layer by layer, surpassing the loquat.
> The mountain ghost has already been seen riding a fragrant chariot,
> The scholar must be dreaming of a colorful brush.
> Magnolia, magnolia, how bizarre,
> Reflecting in the water, particularly suiting the posture of Mount Guye.
> In the bleak morning, the Eastern Sea glows with brilliant rosy clouds,
> In the dark night, the West Garden is nourished by dew.
> The sandalwood heart rolls backwards, emotion boundless,
> The jade face droops low, strength unable to support.
> Hearing that at the Eastern Capital they sit in the open dew,
> Only waiting for the Censor's majestic wind to blow.
> This flower loves to chase the warmth of the east wind,
> The old friend has the transcendent charm of Ji Zhongsan.
> In Shanyang, I heard there is a Hehuan Studio,
> At Stone Lake, they also built a Magnolia Pavilion.
> Slender and graceful, the green trees round the rocky cage,
> Profusely the fragrant flowers fill the mountain stream door.
> In the dock, the noble scion's old road is long,
> In the scroll, Pei Di's new poem is short.
> The new poems are already old, unbearable to hear,
> The desolate pavilion in Jiangnan is separated by autumn clouds.
> Deeply affectionate, its color does not change year after year,
> An eternal fragrant heart I hold to present to you.

&emsp;&emsp;This poem is filled with a deep sense of nostalgia. Because the emotion in the final line is so intense, the entire poem's description seems to be a build-up to it. The final line suggests the poem might be dedicated to someone. "Sitting upright, solitary, nurturing the summoned gentleman's illness" might refer to the poet's yearning for a hermit's life while living alone ("summoned gentleman" can mean a hermit). The "old friend" in the poem and the gentleman to whom the poet wishes to present his fragrant heart should be the same person; otherwise, it would be strange, as it is impolite in a presentation poem to mention too many things unrelated to the recipient. "In Shanyang, I heard there is a Hehuan Studio, / At Stone Lake, they also built a Magnolia Pavilion." This might hint at places the poet and this old friend once visited. Considering the poet indeed spent beautiful times in Shanyang County (now Huai'an) and Stone Lake (located in Suzhou), what the poet is nostalgic for is likely a friend with whom he had a deep relationship in Shanyang and Stone Lake. What kind of person is this old friend? The poem says it is a person with an appearance like Ji Kang. Like Zhu Yuefan's other poems, this one is full of classical allusions, hiding an allusion to the bond between confidants: the friendship between Wang Wei and Pei Di. The friendship between Wang Wei and Pei Di was extremely deep. From Wang Wei's _To Pei Di_, we can see how much Wang Wei liked Pei Di:

> We have not seen each other, not seen each other for a long time.
> Day after day at the head of the spring water, I always remember how we held hands.
> Holding hands, we were originally of one heart; I sigh again how we suddenly parted.
> Our mutual memories are like this today; is our mutual longing deep or not?

&emsp;&emsp;They once lived in seclusion in Wangchuan for over ten years, "floating on boats back and forth, playing the lute and composing poetry, whistling and chanting all day long" (_Old Book of Tang, Biography of Wang Wei_). They often wrote poetry together; the _Wangchuan Collection_ is an anthology of their responsive poems, which includes two poems titled _Magnolia Dock_:

> At the tips of the branches, the lotus-like flowers,
> Emit red calyxes in the mountains.
> The stream door is quiet, without a soul,
> Profusely they bloom and then fall. (Wang Wei)
> The green embankment is enclosed by spring grass,
> The noble scion stays to play alone.
> Moreover, there are magnolia flowers,
> Their colors confused with the lotus. (Pei Di)

&emsp;&emsp;Talented readers rich in literary grace should deeply understand how difficult it is to find someone in tune with oneself, who understands them, and creates alongside them. Wang Wei clearly cherished his confidant Pei Di, who shared his interests. We can see that _Song Feeling the Magnolia_ adapts images from Wang Wei and Pei Di's poems, including the magnolia dock, lotus, red calyx, profusely, stream door, and noble scion. Zhu Yuefan has a rich imagination and is very skilled at writing; he is not the sort to plagiarize others' works when he can't think of a poem. Wang Wei/Pei Di are not the only poets who wrote about magnolia flowers, but Zhu Yuefan quotes Wang Wei/Pei Di's _Magnolia Dock_ almost from beginning to end. He seems to want _Song Feeling the Magnolia_ to strongly associate with Wang Wei/Pei Di. In fact, the conception of this entire poem might lie in praising the bond between confidants, because there are too many images reminding people of Wang Wei and Pei Di. The poet seems afraid readers won't catch it, so he directly includes Pei Di's name. The reference to this bond between Wang Wei and Pei Di further suggests that the gentleman mentioned in _Song Feeling the Magnolia_ is very likely a confidant of Zhu Yuefan. Perhaps when the poet saw the magnolia flowers, he thought of Wang Wei and Pei Di, and thus thought of his past friendship with a certain confidant. Perhaps Zhu Yuefan also wanted to live in seclusion and compose poetry and paint with his confidant like Wang Wei and Pei Di, but reality did not allow it. He was not as wealthy as Wang Wei to buy the Wangchuan estate and live a leisurely life. Furthermore, Zhu Yuefan's sense of responsibility did not allow him to abandon his official post and hide from the world (if the life Zhu Yuefan yearned for in his heart was a secluded pastoral life, then his life is too regrettable, because Zhu Yuefan worked himself to death while in office). Viewed in light of the Wang Wei and Pei Di allusion, the atmosphere of _Song Feeling the Magnolia_ becomes even more ambiguous. Of course, it cannot be ruled out that Zhu Yuefan had never read Wang Wei's _To Pei Di_, did not know their relationship was ambiguous, and thus did not realize readers familiar with the allusion would misunderstand the poem. It also cannot be entirely ruled out that Zhu Yuefan simply ran out of words and copied Wang Wei/Pei Di's _Magnolia Dock_ from beginning to end without intending to invoke their bond as confidants (this is highly unlikely).

&emsp;&emsp;Understanding the allusion hidden in this poem is important because it helps us judge the poet's ideals and character. Obviously, Zhu Yuefan missed the beautiful past of composing poetry with that old friend. Zhu Yuefan has many poems presented to friends. Why didn't he explicitly name this gentleman in this poem? Perhaps because the atmosphere of the last line was too affectionate and ambiguous to conveniently name the recipient. "Deeply affectionate, its color does not change year after year, / An eternal fragrant heart I hold to present to you" seems to mean the poet believes his deep affection remains unchanged year after year (which also indicates the recipient gentleman is an old friend, consistent with the poem's nostalgic sentiment and the "old friend" mentioned earlier), and he wants to present this enduring emotion to that gentleman (whatever his meaning, readers are likely to interpret it this way). This wonderful poetic line contains sincere, lasting, deep affection while possessing a timeless, romantic, and weathered quality. I am still profoundly moved reading it today. Of course, it is also possible the "old friend" in the poem doesn't refer to a specific person, but a group of old friends (Did he have many friends like Ji Kang? Uh, I think Ji Kang isn't that cheap, right? If it refers to a group, they can't all be like Ji Kang; there might be better words to describe a group). The purpose of writing this poem would be to express deep friendship for multiple close friends. However, such an explanation is inconsistent with the atmosphere created by the allusions to Wang Wei and Pei Di, as their story demonstrates a deep bond between _two_ confidants, not a group. Of course, it remains possible that Zhu Yuefan just casually wrote a poem that looked like a presentation to a friend, _Song Feeling the Magnolia_, just for fun, and never actually sent it.

&emsp;&emsp;In Zhu Yuefan's eyes, another person like Ji Kang might be Wang Chong. In _Sending off Zimei Returning to Wu and Mailing It to Elder Wang Yayi_, he mentions, "Ji Kang sighed himself that he had no immortal destiny; Wang Lie reuniting has the ancient style." In this poem, Zhu Yuefan expresses sorrow over his unsmooth life and his longing for Wang Chong. This poem is also one of Zhu Yuefan's most reference-heavy poems, making its meaning hard to decode. Wang Chong was deeply learned and talented, but his official career was poor, failing the examinations repeatedly. Henceforth, he indulged in poetry, calligraphy, and painting, placing his feelings in the mountains and rivers, passing away in his early forties. After Wang Chong's early death, Zhu Yuefan even wrote a poem (_Dreaming of Deceased Friend Lüji at a Wild Temple Beyond the Great Wall_) to commemorate him, expressing deep mourning. However, Wang Chong was not from Shanyang, but Suzhou. In Zhu Yuefan's poetry, "Wu" is often used to refer to Suzhou. But this poem also mentions Stone Lake (in Suzhou). Wu Cheng'en and Zhu Yuefan each have a piece titled "Harmonizing with Historian Hengshan at Stone Lake in Spring" (Historian Hengshan should refer to Wen Zhengming), perhaps written when they visited Wen Zhengming. As for whether Wang Chong came to Shanyang to play, we don't know. From Zhu Yuefan's attitude toward Wang Chong, he was appreciative and tolerant of such talents who were gifted but unskilled at the civil service exams, so it's unlikely he thought Wu Cheng'en was neglecting his duties just because Wu didn't do well in the exams.

&emsp;&emsp;_Parting from Ruzhong_ and _Song Feeling the Magnolia_ clearly share two similar images. "The old friend has the transcendent charm of Ji Zhongsan" means this old friend has a demeanor like Ji Kang. Similarly, Zhu Yuefan's presentation poem to Wu Cheng'en also mentions "Ever since the romantic Ji and Ruan dispersed." Since it was written to Wu Cheng'en, it naturally praises Wu Cheng'en's talent and character as resembling Ji Kang and Ruan Ji (it couldn't be boasting about himself, right? And Zhu Yuefan's conscientiousness was very high, significantly different from Ji Kang and Ruan Ji's personalities, so it's unlikely to refer to himself). Comparing Wu Cheng'en to Ji Kang and Ruan Ji is quite reasonable. Ji Kang showed extraordinary intelligence in his youth and was famous for his deep learning and independent aloofness. Ruan Ji was also talented in his youth, and at the same time, uninhibited and unbound by etiquette. This is somewhat comparable to Wu Cheng'en's personality. "The new poems are already old, unbearable to hear, / The desolate pavilion in Jiangnan is separated by autumn clouds" and "At Shanyang's empty society, wild weeds grow tall" mean roughly the same thing, both reminiscing about past days gathering with literati friends.

&emsp;&emsp;Wang Wei and Pei Di left behind many harmonizing poems. Interestingly, Zhu Yuefan and Wu Cheng'en also have harmonizing poems.

&emsp;&emsp;Zhu Yuefan has a five-character regulated verse poem, _Loujin Shrine_ (from _Shandai Ge Collection_ Vol 7):

> The water palace bears no dust, the lotus flowers act as its four neighbors.
> Begging the spirits, the old witch is drunk; losing the harvest, the wild farmers are poor.
> How can the traveling rain bear to be described; parting winds again send people off.
> Before the forest, the frosty moon is white; through the ages, seeing pure reality.

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en has a poem _Loujin Shrine, Harmonizing with Zhu Zijia_:

> The wild temple's red and green paints are ancient, towering gracefully resting on the blue lake.
> Flags and banners gather the wind and rain, incense smoke is hidden by the water oats.
> The spirit remains with the mountains and rivers, the heart makes the water and moon lonely.
> The willow trees in front of the gate, only house a solitary roosting crow.

&emsp;&emsp;(Obviously, _Loujin Shrine, Harmonizing with Zhu Zijia_ is a harmonizing poem. Zhu Yuefan wrote _Loujin Shrine_ first, and Wu Cheng'en harmonized with one).

&emsp;&emsp;So when Zhu Yuefan wrote "In the dock, the noble scion's old road is long, / In the scroll, Pei Di's new poem is short. / The new poems are already old, unbearable to hear, / The desolate pavilion in Jiangnan is separated by autumn clouds," he very likely thought of the days he wrote poetry with his old friend. Considering Zhu Yuefan wrote "Before our eyes, worldly affairs are chaotic day by day, / Outside of material things, my heart's expectation rests solely on you," indicating Wu Cheng'en was the only person he missed (of course, this could be polite talk, but it at least shows Wu Cheng'en held a very high position in his heart). Comprehensively speaking, the probability that the gentleman (old friend) Zhu Yuefan missed was Wu Cheng'en goes up. If this poem were shown to someone unaware of their past and the allusions within, they wouldn't see anything. But suppose this poem fell into Wu Cheng'en's hands and he was told it was written by Zhu Yuefan. Wu Cheng'en would probably think: "The old friend Zijia misses, who had a deep relationship with him in Shanyang and Suzhou, a figure like Ji Kang, who wrote harmonizing poems with him... isn't he talking about me?" (It cannot be ruled out that Zhu Yuefan missed another old friend from Shanyang or Suzhou, but seeing it, Wu Cheng'en would inevitably think of himself).

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en praised Zhu Yuefan as comparable to Liu Zhen and Cao Zhi, while Zhu Yuefan praised Wu Cheng'en as comparable to Ji Kang and Ruan Ji. These two truly appreciated each other. Their use of the Seven Scholars of Jian'an / Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove to compare each other also illustrates their shared reverence for the Jian'an and Wei-Jin character (of course, it might purely be polite talk, but it at least shows they recognized each other's talents and character). Ji Kang was free-spirited by nature and did not care about becoming an official. Zhu Yuefan felt Wu Cheng'en was like Ji Kang. He probably knew long ago that Wu Cheng'en didn't care much for fame and achievement. Knowing Wu Cheng'en's character, his attitude toward him was still "Outside of material things, my heart's expectation rests solely on you," showing he probably didn't care much whether Wu Cheng'en had an official rank or not. Therefore, I believe they mostly appreciated and sympathized with each other, rather than Zhu Yuefan failing to understand Wu Cheng'en due to his own smooth official career. Ancient intellectuals didn't have many good career options. Choosing to be an official was Zhu Yuefan's conventional choice. Many literary masters in the Ming Dynasty primarily served as officials while doing literary creation on the side; for example, Wang Shouren, Yang Shen, and Xie Jin were top-tier in both political and literary circles.

&emsp;&emsp;The poem _Song Feeling the Magnolia_ is crucial for us to understand the friendship between Zhu Yuefan and Wu Cheng'en, because the yearning for a pastoral hermit life like Wang Wei and Pei Di's shown in Zhu Yuefan's poem indicates he might have shared similar aspirations with Wu Cheng'en (not being too enthusiastic about the officialdom). If this poem was indeed written to Wu Cheng'en, then it is even more impossible for Zhu Yuefan to have formed a rift with Wu Cheng'en because Wu was indifferent to an official career.

&emsp;&emsp;The current speculation about the two forming a rift is based on the assumption that Zhu Yuefan was a serious, conscientious person with a great interest in being an official, and thus couldn't stand Wu Cheng'en's laxity. I think this is untenable. Teacher Cai Tieying believes Zhu Yuefan's "personality was honest and sincere (usually meaning mild-tempered and simple-minded, a description that would make the coffin lids of Zhu Yingdeng, Zhu Yuefan, Wu Cheng'en, and Yang Shen flip open), with an orthodox family background," destined to embark on an official career and thus unable to understand Wu Cheng'en's yearning for literature. I think this evaluation is a massive mistake. We must understand that Zhu Yuefan was a famous literary master in his time. Wang Fuzhi evaluated his status as: "A pillar in midstream, inheriting from Zhishan before him, and pioneering for Ruoshi after him." He was a brilliantly talented litterateur; how can words like "honest and sincere" be used to describe him? In Wu Cheng'en's eyes, Zhu Yuefan possessed peerless talent, and his literary level could rival Liu Zhen and Cao Zhi. Would a person with such literary talent fail to understand Wu Cheng'en's pursuit of literature? And very importantly, judging from the _Shandai Ge Collection_, Zhu Yuefan was quite interested in Daoist philosophy/magic and stories of gods and demons. He and Wu Cheng'en should have had a lot of common ground in this regard. This further proves it is highly unlikely Zhu Yuefan would earnestly admonish Wu Cheng'en for not caring about the civil exams and preferring to write supernatural and mythological stories.

&emsp;&emsp;Moreover, we must distinguish historical evaluations from contemporary ones. In the mid-Ming Dynasty, the top-tier literary figures were masters like Yang Shen and Wang Shouren. Zhu Yingdeng, as one of the "Ten Talents of Hongzhi," had a reputation second to the top tier. Zhu Yuefan was promoted by Yang Shen and hailed as the "Head of the Worthies of Jinling," though his fame did not match his father's. Although Wu Cheng'en has a massive reputation today, since _Journey to the West_ is universally known, Wu Cheng'en indeed had little fame in his own time. So Zhu Yuefan himself was a person with high literary pursuits; he couldn't have blamed Wu Cheng'en for not understanding literary pursuits. (I estimate 99% of Chinese people don't know any of _Instructions for Practical Living_, _Complete Works of Yangming_, or _Great Learning_, but 90% know _Journey to the West_). Obviously, in the Ming Dynasty context, being an official and doing literary creation did not necessarily conflict, nor did taking the civil exams and doing literature. Furthermore, Wu Cheng'en wasn't a rich second-generation kid who didn't need to work and could focus solely on literature. Participating in the civil exams to get an official post to support his family was an ideal choice for him.

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en's lack of success in the civil service examinations was likely caused by his personality. His personality, in his own words, was "impractical and rambling, uncounted among the people of this age" (from _Elegy for Mr. Zhishan_) and "wandering and not studying, not striving to be useful" (from _Epitaph for My Late Father_). Then Zhu Yuefan felt Wu Cheng'en was like Ji Kang. Ji Kang's self-evaluation was "I have been indulgent and unrestrained for a long time, my disposition arrogant and scattered, simple and contrary to etiquette, lazy and slow complementing each other" (from _Letter Breaking off Relations with Shan Juyuan_), meaning he felt his personality was arrogant and lazy. Ji Kang's life experience also gives an impression of a loose personality, letting things take their natural course.

&emsp;&emsp;Both Wu Cheng'en and Ji Kang's personality traits exhibit low conscientiousness. Conscientiousness is one of the five traits in the "Big Five" personality model. People with high conscientiousness are self-disciplined, organized, and cautious. Many studies show that conscientiousness correlates with students' academic achievements, and low conscientiousness is closely related to procrastination. Obviously, Wu Cheng'en's personality affected his academic achievements. In addition, Wu Cheng'en might have suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)—I will discuss this in detail later. If he had ADHD, his academic achievements would have been further impaired.

&emsp;&emsp;Teacher Cai Tieying might not be very familiar with personality theories. Zhu Yuefan's conscientiousness was indeed extremely high (_Ouyu Bu Collection, Biographies of Ten Gentlemen of Guangling: Zhu Yuefan_ records: "In the Xinyou year, when Prince Jing went to his fief, Yuefan was exhausted by illness, yet he still managed all expenses from his sickbed. His mind and spirit were exhausted, and he eventually died in office that autumn."). But high conscientiousness does not mean an "honest and sincere" (dunhou) personality; the two are unrelated. Someone with high conscientiousness can still be unorthodox and have bizarre ideas, their behavior just won't be scattered. For instance, Nikola Tesla's conscientiousness was extremely high, a total workaholic, but could you say he had an "honest and sincere" personality? Wu Cheng'en wouldn't evaluate Zhu Yuefan as "honest and sincere." According to Wu Cheng'en's comments, Zhu Yuefan's traits were brilliantly talented, elegant, and of strong character (I really feel mediocre words like "honest and sincere" are unsuitable for Zhu Yuefan). Similarly, high conscientiousness doesn't mean a person doesn't yearn for a pastoral life. Zhu Yuefan's social responsibility was too strong, making it entirely impossible for him to let go of his duties, but in his heart, he might have still yearned for a secluded pastoral life, because he quoted the allusion to the Magnolia Dock in _Song Feeling the Magnolia_. Furthermore, it shouldn't be assumed that just because Wu Cheng'en's conscientiousness was lower than Zhu Yuefan's, he felt Zhu didn't understand him. Wu Cheng'en might have even appreciated Zhu Yuefan's reliability and seriousness, perhaps finding his earnestness a bit endearing. Conscientiousness is largely innate. After all, in the Ming Dynasty, there were no drugs to improve conscientiousness (now there are; drugs that boost monoamines help somewhat with increasing conscientiousness). What can one do if innate conscientiousness is low? People with low conscientiousness might also want to improve it, but if they truly can't, they can only let it be. Wu Cheng'en teasing Zhu Yuefan in the poem _In a Guest Window in Jinling Facing the Snow, Teasing Zhu Cicao_ might have been because he felt Zhu Yuefan was too conscientious, always working so hard, and hoped he would come over to play and relax properly. Teachers Cai Tieying and Su Xing thought Zhu Yuefan couldn't understand Wu Cheng'en because of his smooth official career, leading to a rift, but they ignored Zhu Yingdeng, Zhu Yuefan, and Wu Cheng'en's reverence for the Wei-Jin character, and the fact that Zhu Yuefan compared Wu Cheng'en to Ji Kang. They also ignored Zhu Yingdeng's influence on Zhu Yuefan. The talented and arrogant Zhu Yingdeng resigned and returned to the fields at forty (and for such an awkward reason, too). As he said, "How could I bow my waist and think of cutting off my grain." With such a father as a role model, would Zhu Yuefan care that much about being an official? According to Teacher Su Xing's research, _Zeng Wu Ruzhong_ and _Zeng Zijia_ were written around when Wu Cheng'en was 37. If so, it is even less likely they had a rift in middle age. After all, Zhu Yuefan knew in his youth that Wu Cheng'en was very like Ji Kang. He must have known long ago that Wu Cheng'en didn't pursue fame and achievement. It's unlikely he would suddenly have a rift with Wu Cheng'en over this in middle age, and his father resigned around that age anyway. How could Zhu Yuefan have the nerve to tell middle-aged Wu Cheng'en he hadn't studied hard enough for the exams? Moreover, Wen Zhengming, a senior respected by both Wu Cheng'en and Zhu Yuefan, also disliked taking the exams and being an official. With such an elder as a role model, would Zhu Yuefan care that much about being an official? A person's ideals and personality are usually set in their youth. Wu Cheng'en's personality showed itself from his youth, as he stated at twenty-seven in the _Epitaph for My Late Father_: "wandering and not studying, not striving to be useful..." A person with strong cognitive abilities and talent views things quite accurately, especially when it comes to dropping classical references; he wouldn't just make an inappropriate comparison casually. Zhu Yuefan comparing Wu Cheng'en to Ji Kang was very apt, showing he understood Wu Cheng'en's personality very well. Wu Cheng'en, a figure like Ji Kang, eventually, like Ji Kang, couldn't adapt to officialdom and was framed. He resigned after being a county deputy magistrate for two years. Zhu Yuefan probably foresaw this long ago. When studying the relationship between Zhu Yuefan and Wu Cheng'en, we must recognize that Zhu Yuefan was a cultural elite of that era; he was not a slow-witted, mediocre person who still couldn't figure out Wu Cheng'en's character by middle age. In conclusion, the speculation about a brotherhood rift is actually built upon a series of unreasonable assumptions (assumptions that practically lower Zhu Yuefan's class).

&emsp;&emsp;Speculation on Zhu Yuefan's MBTI type: Probably INFJ. Zhu Yuefan's _Shandai Ge Collection_ contains many presentation poems; he cared about interpersonal relationships, was talented and imaginative, and was also elegant, upright, conscientious, loved the people, and loved talent. He was not as arrogantly talented as his father, but rather detail-oriented and full of sentiment, so INFJ is highly likely. Zhu Yuefan tended to give positive evaluations to colleagues and other intellectuals. For example, a passage in the _Shandai Ge Collection_ reflects his appreciation for talent and his empathetic nature:

> The beauty of the restoration is attributed to the gentlemen; the grandeur of the mandate is rooted in Heaven. My words and intentions are earnest, only fearing I have nothing to comfort the hearts of Shenbo and Shanfu, lest their great beauty be left unfulfilled. Therefore, it is a presentation. (_Shandai Ge Collection_ p. 281, Source link: [_Shandai Ge Collection_ (Google Books)](https://www.google.com/books/edition/%E5%B1%B1%E5%B8%B6%E9%96%A3%E9%9B%86/_LMsAAAAYAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0))

&emsp;&emsp;We can see that Zhu Yuefan was someone who cared about others' feelings when evaluating them, and he greatly appreciated talented people. Furthermore, although his works were rich in literary grace, they were relatively concrete and lacked abstract theoretical discourse. If he had that, he would have been recorded in history as a philosopher rather than a litterateur.

&emsp;&emsp;Combining Zhu Yuefan's personality traits with the aesthetics and tastes reflected in his works, I infer he held an appreciative and tolerant attitude toward Wu Cheng'en's talent and character. When speculating how one person would view another, we should have a comprehensive and deep understanding of that person's personality, psychology, and behavioral patterns. This requires a comprehensive assessment combining a large amount of psychological knowledge. From the _Shandai Ge Collection_, Zhu Yuefan's social interactions were very extensive. Compared to those who only appeared once, Wu Cheng'en, who he knew from a young age and who appeared multiple times in his collection, indeed had a good relationship with him. However, their relationship clearly wasn't as intimate as Wang Wei/Pei Di's, because the _Shandai Ge Collection_ does not contain a massive amount of interactions between the two.

&emsp;&emsp;Speculation on Wu Cheng'en's MBTI type: First, definitely _N_P. Considering his life experiences showed he was unskilled at socializing and unadapted to officialdom, IN*P is more likely. The 'I' is not very obvious, and T/F is hard to distinguish. Wu Cheng'en was humorous, witty, and emotionally passionate; his monoamine levels might have been quite high.

&emsp;&emsp;Judging from the author's attitude towards characters in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_, the author actually greatly appreciated people with high conscientiousness. Erlang Shen (personality type more like ENTJ) and Zhenyuanzi (personality type more like INTJ) are both very reliable and conscientious people, and Wukong (personality type more like ENTP) appreciates them very much. Although Wukong's own conscientiousness is not very high, he holds a critical attitude towards lazy gluttons like Bajie.

&emsp;&emsp;(The MBTI type of my close friend mentioned earlier, who had an IQ over 165 in her youth, is INTP. She has Asperger's syndrome and simultaneously suffers from ADHD. A major reason her life fell into hardship is that her conscientiousness was absurdly low. She also feels she has a major flaw in this regard, but she likes a friend of ours whose conscientiousness is absurdly high, over three standard deviations above the norm. Wu Cheng'en's conscientiousness must have been higher than my friend's. My friend's case can provide an explanation for the phenomenon of child prodigies falling into hardship as they grow up.)

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en might have been a person with relatively low neuroticism. The average lifespan for men in the Ming Dynasty was 46, while Wu Cheng'en lived to 76, far above the average. Considering Wu Cheng'en's family was poor, his career unsmooth, and his living standards not high, this shows Wu Cheng'en had relatively good anti-aging genes. The current mainstream view on the creation time of the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_ is that he wrote it in his old age. Being able to perform such creation in old age shows his mind was still sharp, which, along with his long lifespan, indirectly proves he had good anti-aging genes. People with many longevity genes usually have low neuroticism, because the premise of longevity is a strong ability to resist inflammation, making them less likely to suffer from neuroinflammation, thus less likely to have mood disorders, maintaining a relatively positive mindset (this is why long-lived elderly people are usually optimistic by nature). Wu Cheng'en's humor and wit might also be related to his optimistic mindset. Note that the degree of neuroticism has little to do with whether one has rich emotions. Emotional richness has a lot to do with neurotransmitter levels, while factors affecting lifespan are related to a series of genes concerning cancer, inflammation, telomere length, antioxidants, etc. (I analyzed this in detail in the article _Analysis of Advantageous Genes in Long-lived Animals_). Wu Cheng'en showed immense grief after the deaths of his father and mentor, showing his emotions were rich and intense. However, with relatively low neuroticism, he wouldn't develop a mood disorder from such changes, and would recover from negative emotions relatively easily. When interpreting Wu Cheng'en's works, we should understand his personality traits. The characters in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_ have rich emotions, but there are indeed no highly neurotic characters. Although the protagonists cry and weep every few days, they all recover quickly from negative emotions; there are no resentful, pessimistic characters. The author of _Dream of the Red Chamber_, on the other hand, probably had higher neuroticism, as there are many highly neurotic characters inside, bearing the brunt being Lin Daiyu, and Cao Xueqin indeed did not live long.

&emsp;&emsp;Another friend of Wu Cheng'en, whom he knew from childhood, Shen Kun, is even more famous. As the first Zhuangyuan (top scholar) from Huai'an, Shen Kun showed outstanding talent from a young age. Shen Kun was Wu Cheng'en's classmate and close friend. He was slightly younger than Wu Cheng'en (Wu born in 1506, Shen in 1507), yet passed the Xiucai exams on the same list as Wu Cheng'en. Because Shen Kun was upright and refused to serve the powerful, he was not highly utilized. In the 35th year of Jiajing, Shen Kun, having returned to Huai'an, sold his family property to resist the wokou (Japanese pirates), recruited over a thousand local militiamen, and drilled them personally. Later, because of this, he was framed by Huai'an Prefect Fan Jia and Supervising Secretary Hu Yingjia for "privately organizing local militia to plot rebellion against the court." This led to him being arrested and imprisoned by the Jiajing Emperor, and he died in prison. The death of his close friend Shen Kun definitely grieved Wu Cheng'en, and this likely deepened his dissatisfaction with the ruling class. Perhaps this was also one of the motivations for him to create the _Journey to the West_ story.

&emsp;&emsp;Shen Kun's deeds remind me of a series of adjectives—"brilliantly talented, arrogant and aloof, iron-boned, skilled in both pen and sword..." Shen Kun's personality and deeds remind me of Wu Cheng'en's Erlang Shen. "His heart so high he doesn't acknowledge the Heavenly family ties; his nature so proud he returns as a god to live at Guan River." Erlang Shen has his own territory and private armed forces, the Grass-headed Divinities. The 1,200 "Grass-headed Divinities" under Erlang Shen's tent are an original creation in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_. In the Yuan Dynasty _Zaju: Erlang Shen Chains the Great Sage Equaling Heaven_, Erlang Shen does not have his private Grass-headed Divinities. The description is: "Erlang Shen, you may lead the greater and lesser ghost soldiers of heaven and earth to capture this demon." In the Yuan _Zaju: Journey to the West_, there is also no description of Erlang Shen's private armed forces. Why does Erlang Shen have private armed forces in the Ming 100-chapter version? Why are there exactly 1,200 Grass-headed Divinities? We cannot rule out that Wu Cheng'en, when molding Erlang Shen, thought of his old friend Shen Kun and his sigh-inducing past, and merged Shen Kun's deeds into Erlang Shen's. Some speculate Tang Seng is a symbol of Shen Kun. I think this speculation is unreasonable because Tang Seng's personality and deeds are vastly different from Shen Kun's. But Shen Kun and Erlang Shen do have some similarities in personality and deeds (both brilliantly talented, arrogant and aloof, skilled in pen and sword, and organized their own private armed forces).

&emsp;&emsp;Among Wu Cheng'en's friends, the one who achieved the highest official rank was Li Chunfang. Li Chunfang was the Zhuangyuan of the 26th year of Jiajing, eventually reaching Minister of Personnel, Grand Secretary of the Zhongji Hall, Junior Preceptor, and concurrent Grand Preceptor of the Heir Apparent. Wu Cheng'en met Li Chunfang relatively late, and Li Chunfang provided significant help to Wu Cheng'en in his official career.

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en was an arrogant and aloof person, as he described in _To Astrologer Sha_: "In my life I refuse to be pitied by others, my joy, laughter, grief, and songs are proud and aloof." As a brilliantly talented genius, it was hard for the masses to understand him. Wu Cheng'en longed for a confidant, but confidants are hard to come by. In his _Elegy for Mr. Zhishan_, mourning his mentor Ge Mu who understood and promoted him, he sighed: "Gratitude is easy, but a true confidant is hard to find."

&emsp;&emsp;However, we can see that Wu Cheng'en also frequently showed lack of confidence and self-blame. Wu Cheng'en showed self-blame in the _Epitaph for My Late Father_:

> Alas, I, the orphan boy Cheng'en, was not favored by Heaven; Heaven sent down severe punishment and took away my father. Moreover, I wandered and did not study, did not strive to be useful, causing my father to pass away suddenly as a commoner.

&emsp;&emsp;In the _Elegy for Mr. Zhishan_, he also showed lack of confidence and self-blame:

> Oh, the deep sorrow! Mr. Zhishan! Oh, the deep sorrow! Mr. Zhishan! The ancients said: Gratitude is easy, but a true confidant is hard to find. I, Cheng'en, am a petty scholar of Huaihai, impractical and rambling, uncounted among the people of this age, yet you graced me with your recognition; trapped in mud and poverty, met with endless ridicule, your belief in me was greater than my own belief in myself. Now you have passed away, who will care for my vain and substanceless writings? There will surely be those in the world who praise them, but beyond heaven and earth, who can truly understand my heart!

&emsp;&emsp;What is going on here? This might be because Wu Cheng'en knew he was an extraordinary genius, and he felt proud of it, but he also knew his personality was scattered (low conscientiousness), causing him to fail in his studies and career, thus generating a contradiction of being both arrogant and having an inferiority complex. (My close friend, the fallen child prodigy with an IQ over 165, also has this mentality. On one hand, she feels the netizens she interacts with online are almost all idiots; on the other hand, she feels unreliable and inferior to those truly successful famous people, feeling she let her parents down). Understanding Wu Cheng'en's personality and mentality helps us understand his attitude towards his friends. From this perspective, it is even more impossible for Wu Cheng'en to complain about and mock Zhu Yuefan. Even if Zhu Yuefan blamed him, he would probably gladly accept it and blame himself for being unreliable, rather than arrogantly feeling Zhu Yuefan was looking down on him.

&emsp;&emsp;Perhaps Wu Cheng'en integrated his longing for a confidant and the deep emotions he shared with equally outstanding, like-minded friends into his portrayal of Sun Wukong's experiences in making friends.

&emsp;&emsp;Why did some literati and scholar-officials revere the Wei-Jin character? An important feature of the Wei-Jin character is independent aloofness. The existence of the imperial examination system made literati and scholar-officials the class with the highest intellectual level in ancient times, naturally containing a large number of geniuses. The aloofness and independence of geniuses stems partly from their difficulty in being understood by the masses, and partly from the social obstacles often found in them. A series of high-IQ genes increase the risk of autism. Foremost among them is the NBPF gene, whose DUF1220 protein domain copy number profoundly affected the evolution of primate brain capacity and greatly contributes to the intelligence gap between individuals. At the same time, DUF1220 copy number is also closely related to autistic traits. I discussed this issue in detail in the article _The Neuroscience Foundation of INTJ/INTP Personality Formation_. Furthermore, the proportion of individuals with Asperger's syndrome who co-occur with ADHD is quite high, which I won't detail here. In short, the more genius a person is, the easier it is for them to be isolated from the masses, making them aloof and independent.

&emsp;&emsp;Given Wu Cheng'en's astonishing erudition, it means he likely had an abnormal number of neurons allowing him to encode and store vast amounts of information. The main function of DUF1220 is to amplify the number of neurons. Among geniuses of Wu Cheng'en's level, many have significant Asperger's traits and often accompanied ADHD symptoms (reasons unknown, perhaps some comorbid factors). Some geniuses with autistic traits love solitude on one hand, but are tormented by loneliness and long for understanding on the other, making them deeply crave a confidant.

&emsp;&emsp;The Erlang Shen in _Black Myth: Wukong_ has more autistic traits compared to the Erlang Shen in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_, because he is simply too capable of enduring solitude. But unfortunately, his words and actions do not match his persona of "Manifested Saint across heavens, known as a great talent." This is a major reason why _Black Myth: Wukong_ caused me immense psychological trauma. To heal my psychological trauma, I decided to make a _Black Myth: Wukong_ fan game to mold an Erlang Shen who is both wise and courageous, aiming to become the overlord of the Three Realms, saving all living beings, saving Sun Wukong, and saving himself, acting as a strategist and tactician. I have already spent months on this game, and I will try hard to finish it and share it with everyone.

&emsp;&emsp;We can see that compared to Wu Cheng'en, who was unsuccessful in his official career, Zhu Yuefan and Shen Kun—two highly conscientious friends Wu Cheng'en met in his youth—went much further in their official careers. Whether in background or personal achievements, they were more prominent than Wu Cheng'en, but they always appreciated Wu Cheng'en's talent and maintained a lifelong friendship with him. This is somewhat similar to the friendship between Zhenyuanzi, Erlang Shen, and Sun Wukong. Zhenyuanzi and Erlang Shen's status is more prominent than Sun Wukong's. They both felt Sun Wukong was powerful but untamed, uninhibited, and slightly unreliable, yet they still appreciated Sun Wukong and formed a deep friendship with him.

&emsp;&emsp;Wu Cheng'en's view on marriage also mainly featured elitism. His wife was a descendant of Minister of Revenue Ye Qi, which can be considered a young lady of a great family, a descendant of a prominent house. Wu Cheng'en and Lady Ye had a deep relationship. We know that in the Yuan _Zaju: Journey to the West_, Sun Wukong had a wife (Jiaozi, daughter of the King of the Fire Wheel Golden Tripod Country), and Sun Wukong also had a bunch of brothers and sisters. Sun Wukong's extended family could be said to be very lively. But in the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_, not only are Sun Wukong's brothers and sisters gone, but his wife is also gone, making him look like a loner. From the author's writing psychology, this might be due to the following reasons: Wu Cheng'en's family was relatively small, with only one older sister. This might have affected his interest in whether Sun Wukong had siblings. Also, due to Wu Cheng'en's proud and aloof personality, he might have preferred to mold a solitary image of Sun Wukong. Jiaozi was snatched by force by Sun Wukong, and Jiaozi didn't like him. If he wrote a deeply affectionate wife for Sun Wukong, and Sun Wukong later became a monk to fetch scriptures, wouldn't Sun Wukong be abandoning his wife? Whether it's unrequited love or abandoning a wife, neither fits Wu Cheng'en's view on marriage.

&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, Wu Cheng'en not arranging a wife for Sun Wukong might also be related to his yearning for a certain ideal life at times. Wu Cheng'en often composed poems about plum blossoms, with one line saying, "Carrying wine in search of fragrance, who wouldn't admire it? But for a true soulmate, there is only Lin Hejing." (_Man Jiang Hong_, two stanzas). Lin Hejing was a famous aloof literatus who neither served as an official nor married in his entire life. There were many aloof literati in ancient times, but those who could escape secular etiquette, resist family pressure, abandon Confucian moral norms, and be so aloof as to not even take a wife were truly very few. (Lin Hejing is also a poet I particularly like. Speaking of this, I am reminded of the beautiful times I spent treading the green and chatting joyfully with a confidant at Gushan in West Lake, and I can't help but feel melancholy). Those who consider Lin Hejing a soulmate probably hold a relatively detached attitude toward marriage, not being too attached to it, and some might even be highly averse to it. If _Journey to the West_ was Wu Cheng'en's work in his later years, looking back on his life, with his close friends and wife already passed away, Wu Cheng'en might have felt that living like Lin Hejing—neither serving nor marrying, accompanied only by plum blossoms and white cranes—would also be very good. If he himself thought this way, he naturally wouldn't find it strange that Sun Wukong didn't marry. We can see that Wu Cheng'en was vigilant against lust but longed for a confidant. This mentality might be the reason he described a Sun Wukong who had no girlfriend/wife, was not seduced by women, but had male confidants who shared mutual appreciation. Sun Wukong's friendship preferences carry a strong fondness for outstanding talent, independent arrogance, and noble character (a type of intellectual aesthetic with autistic traits). Although this doesn't really harmonize with Sun Wukong's background setting as a demon king of Flower Fruit Mountain, it can only be said that this was the author's personal preference.

&emsp;&emsp;Lin Bu had relatively significant Asperger's syndrome traits. He was deeply learned and talented, indifferent to fame and wealth, and had a very low need for socializing. This is a typical Asperger's trait caused by high-IQ genes. Wu Cheng'en always carried a solitary aura. Wu Cheng'en always felt he was hard to understand ("In my life I refuse to be pitied by others, my joy, laughter, grief, and songs are proud and aloof"). He spent his whole life longing for a confidant ("Gratitude is easy, but a true confidant is hard to find"). This is actually a manifestation of high-IQ autistic traits. Perhaps the arrogant and solitary traits in Lin Bu strongly attracted him. Compared to Ji Kang, Lin Bu, who never served or married, was even more solitary and cold. Perhaps Lin Bu resonated with him, making him sigh that only Lin Bu was his (or the plum blossom's) soulmate. Of course, it cannot be ruled out that Wu Cheng'en wrote this line purely to make up the word count (but why bring up Lin Bu?). As a cultural celebrity, literati naturally knew Lin Bu's allusions, but considering Lin Bu a soulmate is still a rare ideological sentiment. The lifestyle Lin Bu chose was too special. Unless you were strongly attracted by his talent, solitude, incongruity, and indifference to fame and wealth, it would be hard for you to treat him as a spiritual soulmate.

&emsp;&emsp;If the Ming 100-chapter version of _Journey to the West_ was indeed written by Wu Cheng'en, knowing that Wu Cheng'en longed for confidants and that the author indeed arranged mentally connected confidant characters for Sun Wukong in the novel... why didn't he arrange a female confidant for Sun Wukong? It might just be that he had never met such a woman. Additionally, there were very few similar cases in history for him to reference, lacking experience to draw upon for description. Obviously, understanding Wu Cheng'en required a high threshold of knowledge level, and one had to have an "proud and aloof" aura. In the Ming Dynasty, an era where women's educational levels were low and they rarely went out to socialize, it was not easy to find a talented and aloof woman to be a wife. Of course, in prominent families and scholarly households, there were certainly some talented women (for example, Yang Shen married the talented woman Huang E; but Yang Shen had the capital to do so. Yang Shen and Wu Cheng'en don't seem to have interacted, but Yang Shen promoted Zhu Yuefan, and Zhu Yuefan wrote many presentation poems to Yang Shen). But Wu Cheng'en's family background wasn't very good, and having failed in the civil exams, he couldn't rely on his own status to pick such a wife. He lacked the capital to let him choose his ideal wife. Being able to marry a descendant of a prominent family like Lady Ye was already considered good. Lady Ye was clearly not a highly talented woman (even if her ancestors had talent, it might not have been maintained down to her generation), because Lady Ye left no literary works. If Lady Ye were a smart and talented woman like Li Qingzhao, Wu Cheng'en's story would definitely be more exciting. But among Wu Cheng'en's male friends, there were somewhat a few who approached his ideal confidant type. After all, mingling in academic circles, Wu Cheng'en still had opportunities to interact with extremely talented men. Talented women didn't show their faces in public and had to be known through personal connections, while talented men gathered in academies and were much easier to meet. Lady Ye might have appreciated and cared for Wu Cheng'en, but if she lacked talent, Wu Cheng'en couldn't gain the joy of intellectual exchange from her. Such joy, he could only seek from male friends, which would affect his portrayal of his characters. Moreover, such life experiences easily make people believe that mutual appreciation between confidants only exists between males, or make people more inclined to mold mutual appreciation between male confidants (writing from one's own experience feels more authentic). This might have also influenced Wu Cheng'en's portrayal of Sun Wukong, resulting in Sun Wukong having no female confidants. As for that non-sapiosexual romantic love between men and women, considering Wu Cheng'en's vigilance against lust ("The soft village of women may intoxicate, but you must remember the blade hanging above"), he probably felt there was no need to arrange it. Some netizens say the Yuan _Zaju: Journey to the West_ arranged a wife for Sun Wukong, which is relatively humanized (I don't think it's very humanized, because Jiaozi didn't like Sun Wukong). But for some intelligent sapiosexuals longing for confidant bonds, the bond of a confidant is enough to make them happy. We can see that under Wu Cheng'en's pen, Sun Wukong has no two-way fondness or attachment to beautiful female immortals or demons, indicating these female immortals and demons cannot bring him joy. However, Sun Wukong is deeply attached to Zhenyuanzi, with whom he hits it off perfectly. People become attached to things because those things bring them positive emotions. Obviously, Sun Wukong really liked being with Zhenyuanzi, to the point of not wanting to let go, showing Zhenyuanzi brought him a lot of positive emotions. Probably in the eyes of Wu Cheng'en, who longed for confidants, such emotion was already very beautiful. If we look at it from the angle that Wu Cheng'en bestowed his own views on friendship upon Sun Wukong, we can easily understand why Sun Wukong's views on friendship are the way they are.

&emsp;&emsp;Sun Wukong rarely shows an elitist view on friendship in later _Journey to the West_ stories, which is obviously related to the authors' own aesthetic tastes and life experiences. Based on my analysis above, we can see that Wukong's high-standard elitist view on friendship is in the same vein as Wu Cheng'en's view on friendship. Wu Cheng'en's elitist/sapiosexual preferences in making friends are hard to resonate with the general public. His emotionally rich Sun Wukong, who has deep relationships and relatively close physical contact with male friends (Zhenyuanzi "taking the Pilgrim by the hand," Sun Wukong and Erlang Shen "holding hands and supporting each other") would probably make many straight male readers lose their minds.

&emsp;&emsp;In summary, a setting where "Sun Wukong falls in love with the Corpse Demon and kills the Corpse Demon" would probably be unbearable for Wu Cheng'en (to the point he couldn't resist going to angrily confront Feng Ji), because such a setting is too vastly different from Wu Cheng'en's views on friendship and marriage. The Corpse Demon is a mountain-dwelling minor demon without background, fighting alone, possessing absolutely none of the qualities Wu Cheng'en appreciates (like prominent background, outstanding talent, aloof personality, elegant temperament, etc.—in short, just too low). In my view, the nature of Sun Wukong falling in love with the Corpse Demon is comparable to Wu Cheng'en marrying a prostitute.
