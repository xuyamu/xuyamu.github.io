&emsp;&emsp;This article will introduce several currently scientifically-backed anti-aging methods, ordered from lowest to highest based on the money required for anti-aging.

**I. Caloric Restriction**

Cost: Free

&emsp;&emsp;What? There is actually a free anti-aging method? Caloric restriction (CR) refers to restricting the total daily calorie intake while providing the organism with sufficient nutritional components, such as essential amino acids and vitamins, ensuring that the organism does not suffer from malnutrition. Research on caloric restriction extending lifespan has a long history. As early as 1935, American scientist McCay and others discovered that restricting the caloric intake of rats by 40% could extend their lifespan by 30% compared to the control group. Through experiments, caloric restriction has been proven to have life-extending effects in various species, including nematodes, rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.

&emsp;&emsp;To list a well-known study in recent years: a cross-century study published in the prestigious journal _Science_ in 2009 found that reducing caloric intake can delay aging and significantly delay the onset of age-related problems in rhesus monkeys, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and brain atrophy.

&emsp;&emsp;Of course, the life-extending effect of caloric restriction is limited after all, and it is impossible to drastically extend biological lifespan.

**II. Exercise**

&emsp;&emsp;Cost: Free

&emsp;&emsp;It is well-known common sense that exercise is beneficial to health. There is a lot of research on exercise and lifespan. Here is an example: according to research in _mayoclinic progressions_, data from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) shows that certain sports can help you live stronger and longer. In a 25-year follow-up study of more than 8,500 people, they found that compared to their sedentary peers, these sports and activities increased the life expectancy of active participants:

&emsp;&emsp;Tennis: 9.7 years

&emsp;&emsp;Badminton: 6.2 years

&emsp;&emsp;Soccer: 4.7 years

&emsp;&emsp;Cycling: 3.7 years

&emsp;&emsp;Swimming: 3.4 years

&emsp;&emsp;Jogging: 3.2 years

&emsp;&emsp;Calisthenics: 3.1 years

**III. Common Anti-Aging Supplements and Drugs**

&emsp;&emsp;Cost: Three digits/month

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, there have been some studies on the anti-aging effects of well-known old drugs, representatives of which include metformin, acarbose, and rapamycin. Studies have found that an appropriate dose of metformin can extend the lifespan of most genotypes of mice, but the magnitude is mostly within 10%. In 2019, a paper published in _Aging Cell_ titled "Acarbose improves health and lifespan in aging HET3 mice" pointed out that a certain dose of acarbose increased the median lifespan of male HET3 mice by 16% or 17%, and increased the median lifespan of female HET3 mice by 4% or 5%. In 2014, a paper published in _Aging Cell_ titled "Rapamycin-mediated lifespan increase in mice is dose and sex dependent and metabolically distinct from dietary restriction" showed that rapamycin increased the median lifespan of mice by 23% (males) to 26% (females).

&emsp;&emsp;Some ingredients widely used in the supplement field have also been proven to have life-extending effects in animal experiments. For example, alpha-ketoglutarate has shown good life-extending effects in animal experiments. A 2020 paper published in the _Cell_ sub-journal _Cell Metabolism_ titled "Alpha-Ketoglutarate, the Metabolite that Regulates Aging in Mice" found that feeding mice alpha-ketoglutarate can reduce systemic inflammatory cytokine levels, improve coat color and hair condition, gait, and kyphosis in female mice, and help maintain muscle mass, gait, and grip strength in male mice, with fewer tumors and better eye health. In addition, the lifespans of both male and female mice were extended.

&emsp;&emsp;Furthermore, there are several epigenetic drugs that have been widely used clinically, which I have introduced in this answer:

[Introduction to several common epigenetic drugs](https://www.zhihu.com/question/523372643/answer/2404859877)

&emsp;&emsp;All in all, common anti-aging supplements and drugs have a relatively high cost-effectiveness because they have certain anti-aging effects and are affordable.

**IV. Frontier Rare Anti-Aging Drugs**

&emsp;&emsp;Cost: Four digits/month

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, some new molecules with anti-aging effects are appearing in academia, but they have not yet been widely used in clinical or consumer markets. To give a few examples:

ISRIB:

&emsp;&emsp;A paper titled "Small molecule cognitive enhancer reverses age-related memory decline in mice" published in _eLife_ in December 2020 investigated the impact of a compound called ISRIB on the memory of aging mice. The paper found that ISRIB can reverse brain aging in mice. ISRIB is precisely an ISR inhibitor, which is a PERK inhibitor; by inhibiting PERK, it can regulate eIF2α phosphorylation. The small molecule ISRIB acts to antagonize the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) by inhibiting eIF2α phosphorylation, thereby activating eIF2B.

&emsp;&emsp;Besides anti-aging, ISRIB also has the effect of preventing long COVID. According to the paper "SARS-CoV-2 infection induces beta cell transdifferentiation", after SARS-CoV-2 infection, beta cell insulin expression decreases, and alpha and acinar cell marker (including glucagon and trypsin 1) expression increases, indicating cell transdifferentiation. Trajectory analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced eIF2 pathway-mediated beta cell transdifferentiation, and this phenotype could be reversed by the trans-integrated stress response inhibitor (trans-ISRIB).

PKR Inhibitors (C16):

&emsp;&emsp;PKR is also one of the four kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α. Can inhibiting PKR also improve memory? Yes, there is currently some related research. For example, in the study "PKR Inhibition Rescues Memory Deficit and ATF4 Overexpression in ApoE ε4 Human Replacement Mice", researchers found that injecting a PKR inhibitor into ApoE4 mice could rescue memory impairment and attenuate the increased mRNA expression of ATF4 in ApoE4 mice. In the study "Suppression of PKR Promotes Network Excitability and Enhanced Cognition by Interferon-γ-Mediated Disinhibition", the authors explored the relationship between PKR and memory. The study found that the deletion of PKR increased late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal slices. These effects were caused by a selective reduction in GABAergic synaptic function mediated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). In short, the results of this study indicate that PKR can well regulate network activities, and these activities must store given fragments during the learning process. Since PKR activity is altered in several neurological diseases, this kinase provides a promising new target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. As a first step in this direction, the study demonstrated that selective PKR inhibitors can achieve performance similar to that of PKR-deficient mice.

**V. Cell Therapy**

&emsp;&emsp;Cost: Five digits/time

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, cell therapy for anti-aging is being favored by the wealthy class. The most commonly used in cell therapy for anti-aging are stem cells. Stem cells are a type of cell with self-renewal capabilities, able to produce at least one type of highly differentiated daughter cell. Stem cell transplantation therapy involves transplanting healthy stem cells into a patient's body to repair or replace damaged cells or tissues, thereby achieving the goal of curing. The scope of stem cell transplantation therapy is very broad; generally, it can treat nervous system diseases, immune system diseases, and some other internal and surgical diseases.

&emsp;&emsp;Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells are often used for anti-aging, but stem cell transplantation therapy has significant limitations. On the one hand, allogeneic stem cells will slowly be eliminated by the immune system after transplantation; on the other hand, the amount of stem cell transplantation is limited. This makes stem cell therapy limited and not highly cost-effective.

**VI. Gene Therapy**

&emsp;&emsp;Cost: Five to seven digits (depending on the vector used)

&emsp;&emsp;Gene therapy refers to a treatment method that achieves a certain therapeutic effect by altering the gene expression of an organism. Gene therapy can permanently change the treated person's genes, or it can alter the treated person's gene expression for a period of time. The former is represented by gene editing, lentiviral vector gene therapy, etc., while the latter includes RNA, adenoviral vector gene therapy, AAV vector gene therapy (studies have found that AAV has a small probability of integrating into the genome), plasmid vector gene therapy, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;There are already many studies on the impact of specific genes on lifespan through transgenic mice. This website lists a large number of related experiments:

[Ageing-Associated Genes in Model Organisms](https://genomics.senescence.info/genes/search.php?organism=Mus+musculus&show=4)

&emsp;&emsp;Besides these genes that have been experimentally verified in transgenic mice to be correlated with lifespan, genetic research on long-lived animals may also help us find some genetic targets. There is a huge difference in lifespan among different animal species. Based on research on different long-lived animals, it is easy for us to find that long-lived animals generally share the following commonalities:

&emsp;&emsp;Powerful telomere maintenance function, powerful DNA repair ability, and powerful anti-cancer ability. Why are these three major factors related to lifespan? Let's see how these three major factors affect it:

&emsp;&emsp;Telomeres are special structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, the telomere shortens a bit. When the telomere shortens to a certain extent, the cell will lose its ability to divide. Maintaining telomere integrity is crucial for cell survival, so to live long, the telomere maintenance ability must be strong. This may explain why telomere-related genes in long-lived animals generally have positive selection advantages. As animals develop and grow, DNA faces the risk of damage due to various internal factors (reactive oxygen species generated by mitochondria causing DNA damage) and external factors (various toxic molecules entering the body and destroying DNA). DNA mutations can cause various problems such as telomere shortening, cellular senescence, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis; therefore, for animals to maintain a healthy body, DNA repair capability is essential. If an animal gets cancer, it will quickly die, so to live long, the anti-cancer ability must be strong.

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, two highly remarkable studies related to anti-aging and life extension gene therapy have been published:

&emsp;&emsp;In December 2020, a research team from Harvard Medical School published a cover paper in the journal _Nature_, titled "Reprogramming to recover youthful epigenetic information and restore vision". This paper is a blockbuster study for anti-aging research. Why is this paper so important? Because this article proposed a method that solved the risk of tumorigenesis caused by using Yamanaka factors for in vivo reprogramming.

&emsp;&emsp;The name Yamanaka factors originates from the Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka. In October 2012, Shinya Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for inventing the method of creating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPScell). Shinya Yamanaka found that by expressing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 in somatic cells, somatic cells can be turned into pluripotent stem cells. In this process, somatic cells reverse epigenetics through reprogramming, returning to a state similar to embryonic stem cells. So can we use Yamanaka factors to rejuvenate living organisms? Experiments show that we can. As early as 2016, through the experiments in the paper "In Vivo Amelioration of Age-Associated Hallmarks by Partial Reprogramming", researchers at the Salk Institute found that short-term reprogramming of progeroid mice could extend their lifespan by 30%.

&emsp;&emsp;This paper used a so-called partial reprogramming technique. This technique achieves partial reprogramming by cyclically and transiently inducing Yamanaka factors. Why cyclically and transiently induce Yamanaka factors? Because continuously inducing the expression of Yamanaka factors will cause tumors in the living organism. A recent paper published in _Stem Cell Reports_ also used this method:

[In Vivo Reprogramming Ameliorates Aging Features in Dentate Gyrus Cells and Improves Memory in Mice](www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711(20)30385-4)

&emsp;&emsp;The authors of this paper reversed brain aging in mice by cyclically and transiently inducing Yamanaka factors to reprogram the mouse brain (the specific method was using tetracycline to induce the expression of Yamanaka factor genes in transgenic mice).

&emsp;&emsp;Cyclically and transiently inducing Yamanaka factors requires grasping the right degree; excessive expression will cause tumors, and too little expression will not yield good anti-aging effects. So is there any safe and easy-to-control method? The paper by the Harvard Medical School team found a way to solve the problem—expressing only three factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4, can reverse epigenetics without causing tumors. The experiment in this paper was quite successful; in the experiment, by using AAV to overexpress the three Yamanaka factors OSK, the gene expression of old mice returned to a level quite similar to that of young mice and enabled nerve regeneration (to some extent, the mice were rejuvenated).

&emsp;&emsp;In June 2021, BioViva published the results of a life-extension research project initiated as early as 2018 on the non-peer-reviewed preprint website bioRxiv, claiming to have proven for the first time that Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can extend the lifespan of mice as a gene therapy via intranasal administration or injection routes.

&emsp;&emsp;The researchers stated that the average lifespan of mice carrying exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or MCMVFST) in mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) was extended by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively.

Paper link:[New intranasal and injectable gene therapy for healthy life extension](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.26.449305v1)

&emsp;&emsp;This is merely the effect of overexpressing a single gene, TERT or FST, yet the life-extending effect is so obvious. According to genetic research on long-lived animals, we know that a long-lived species often has multiple anti-aging genes. From this, we can reasonably infer: if we overexpress multiple anti-aging genes, it might be possible to drastically extend lifespan.

&emsp;&emsp;So the question arises, does gene therapy cost money? Many gene therapies cost a lot of money. Among the gene therapy drugs already on the market, there is no shortage of astronomical orphan drugs costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. However, for us biological researchers, it is possible to obtain gene therapy reagents at a price acceptable to the middle class. Gene therapies have different vectors, and different vectors have different prices. Here is a brief introduction to several common gene therapy vectors and their costs:

&emsp;&emsp;Naked plasmid: Amplified using bacteria, therefore cheap. Plasmids are circular DNA and difficult to enter cells, so the transfection rate is low. Non-integrating, short expression time (can only last for more than a month). Poor effect. Low immunogenicity. The price of clinical-grade plasmids in China is four digits RMB per 1mg.

&emsp;&emsp;Plasmid + transfection reagent: Relatively cheap, high transfection rate. Short expression time (can only last for more than a month). Effect is okay. Low immunogenicity. The ratio of plasmid to required transfection reagent price is about 1:3. For the middle class to drastically extend lifespan, relying on this method is currently feasible. With the development of transfection reagent technology, the gene therapy method of plasmid plus transfection reagent may become increasingly common.

&emsp;&emsp;AAV: Because it needs to be produced using animal cells (293T, insect cells, etc.), and animal cell culture is expensive, AAV is very expensive. AAV viruses can enter cells on their own, so the transfection rate is high. The gene therapies already on the market are mainly AAV. Long expression time (lasts half a year). Medium immunogenicity (lower than adenovirus, higher than plasmid), the effect will decrease after secondary use.

&emsp;&emsp;Lentivirus: Because it needs to be produced using animal cells, and animal cell culture is expensive, lentivirus is very expensive. But lentivirus is a retrovirus; with one treatment, it integrates into the host genome and can be stably expressed.

&emsp;&emsp;RNA + transfection reagent: The representative is the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. RNA survival time is short, only a few hours. As an anti-aging treatment, the cost-effectiveness might be too low. Long-term use is also expensive, and if the transfection reagent has a certain toxicity, using it every day is not very feasible either. RNA has no risk of integration, which is its advantage.
