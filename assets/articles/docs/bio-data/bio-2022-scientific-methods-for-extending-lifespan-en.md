## Scientific Methods for Life Extension

&emsp;&emsp;From a scientific perspective, several methods have currently been proven in studies to extend lifespan: caloric restriction, exercise, drugs, dietary supplements, and gene therapy. Next, I will analyze the pros and cons of these methods and explore potential scientific techniques that could lead to biological immortality.

### Caloric Restriction

&emsp;&emsp;Caloric restriction (CR) refers to limiting the total daily calorie intake while providing the organism with sufficient nutritional components, such as essential amino acids and vitamins, to ensure no malnutrition occurs. Research on extending lifespan through caloric restriction has a long history.

&emsp;&emsp;As early as 1935, American scientist McCay and his colleagues found that restricting the caloric intake of rats by 40% could extend their lifespan by 30% compared to the control group. Through experiments, caloric restriction has been proven to have life-extending effects across various species, including nematodes, rats, mice, and rhesus monkeys.

&emsp;&emsp;To cite a well-known study in recent years: a landmark, cross-century study published in the prestigious journal _Science_ in 2009 found that reducing caloric intake can delay aging and significantly postpone age-related issues in rhesus monkeys, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and brain atrophy.

&emsp;&emsp;Of course, the life-extending effect of caloric restriction is ultimately limited. It cannot drastically extend biological lifespan and is still very far from the goal of immortality.

### Exercise

&emsp;&emsp;It is common knowledge that exercise is beneficial to health, and there is an abundance of research on exercise and lifespan. Here is an example: according to research in _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_, data from the Copenhagen City Heart Study (CCHS) shows that certain sports can help you live a stronger and longer life. In a 25-year follow-up study of over 8,500 people, researchers found that compared to their sedentary peers, these sports and activities increased the life expectancy of active participants by the following amounts:

Tennis: 9.7 years

Badminton: 6.2 years

Soccer: 4.7 years

Cycling: 3.7 years

Swimming: 3.4 years

Jogging: 3.2 years

Calisthenics: 3.1 years

Obviously, no matter what kind of exercise it is, it cannot make a person immortal.

### Drugs and Reagents

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, there have been studies on the anti-aging effects of well-known older drugs. Representatives in this area include metformin, acarbose, and rapamycin. Studies have found that an appropriate dose of metformin can extend the lifespan of most genotypes of mice, but the increase is mostly within 10%. In 2019, a paper titled "Acarbose improves health and lifespan in aging HET3 mice" published in _Aging Cell_ pointed out that a certain dose of acarbose increased the median lifespan of male HET3 mice by 16% or 17% and female HET3 mice by 4% or 5%. In 2014, another paper in _Aging Cell_ titled "Rapamycin-mediated lifespan increase in mice is dose and sex dependent and metabolically distinct from dietary restriction" showed that rapamycin increased the median lifespan of mice by 23% (males) to 26% (females).

&emsp;&emsp;Recently, some new small-molecule reagents with anti-aging functions have also emerged. For example, in animal experiments, ISRIB was found to reverse brain aging.

### Dietary Supplements

&emsp;&emsp;Some ingredients widely used in the dietary supplement industry have also been proven to have life-extending effects in animal experiments. For instance, alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has shown good life-extending effects in animal trials. A 2020 paper published in the _Cell_ sister journal _Cell Metabolism_, titled "Alpha-Ketoglutarate, the Metabolite that Regulates Aging in Mice," found that feeding mice alpha-ketoglutarate could lower systemic inflammatory cytokine levels. It improved the coat color and hair condition, gait, and kyphosis of female mice, and helped maintain muscle mass, gait, and grip strength in male mice. Furthermore, these mice had fewer tumors and better eye health. In addition, the lifespans of both male and female mice were extended.

&emsp;&emsp;Naturally, there is currently no supplement on the market that grants immortality upon use.

### Gene Therapy

&emsp;&emsp;Gene therapy refers to a treatment method that achieves a therapeutic effect by altering the gene expression of an organism. Gene therapy can permanently change a patient's genes, or it can alter gene expression for a certain period. Representatives of the former include gene editing and lentiviral vector gene therapy, while the latter includes RNA therapy, adenoviral vector gene therapy, AAV vector gene therapy (studies have found that AAV has a small probability of integrating into the genome), and plasmid vector gene therapy.

&emsp;&emsp;There have already been many studies using transgenic mice to investigate the impact of specific genes on lifespan. This website lists a large number of related experiments:

[Ageing-Associated Genes in Model Organisms](https://genomics.senescence.info/genes/search.php?organism=Mus+musculus&show=4)

&emsp;&emsp;In addition to these genes that have been experimentally verified in transgenic mice to correlate with lifespan, genetic studies on long-lived animals may also help us find some genetic targets. Lifespans vary hugely across different animal species. Based on studies of various long-lived animals, it is easy to see that they generally share the following common traits:

&emsp;&emsp;Strong telomere maintenance capabilities, powerful DNA repair capabilities, and robust anti-cancer abilities. Why are these three major factors related to lifespan? Let's look at how they exert their influence:

&emsp;&emsp;Telomeres are special structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten slightly. When telomeres shorten to a certain extent, the cell loses its ability to divide. Maintaining telomere integrity is crucial for cell survival. Therefore, to live a long life, telomere maintenance capabilities must be strong. This may explain why telomere-related genes in long-lived animals generally possess a positive selection advantage.

&emsp;&emsp;As an animal develops and grows, its DNA faces the risk of damage due to various internal factors (such as reactive oxygen species produced by mitochondria causing DNA damage) and external factors (various toxic molecules entering the body and destroying DNA). DNA mutations can cause telomere shortening, cellular senescence, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. Therefore, DNA repair capability is vital for animals to maintain a healthy body. If an animal develops cancer, it will quickly die; thus, to live long, anti-cancer capabilities must be strong.

&emsp;&emsp;In recent years, two highly remarkable studies related to anti-aging and life-extending gene therapy have been published:

&emsp;&emsp;In December 2020, a research team from Harvard Medical School published a cover paper in the journal _Nature_ titled "Reprogramming to recover youthful epigenetic information and restore vision." This paper is a blockbuster in anti-aging research. Why is it so important? Because it proposed a method that solved the tumorigenic risk associated with using Yamanaka factors for in vivo reprogramming.

&emsp;&emsp;The name "Yamanaka factors" comes from Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka. In October 2012, Yamanaka won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering a method to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). He discovered that expressing four factors—Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4—in somatic cells could turn them into pluripotent stem cells. In this process, the somatic cells reverse their epigenetics through reprogramming, reverting to a state similar to embryonic stem cells. So, can we use Yamanaka factors to rejuvenate a living organism? Experiments show that we can. As early as 2016, researchers at the Salk Institute found that subjecting progeria mice to short-term reprogramming could extend their lifespan by 30%. Related paper:

[In Vivo Amelioration of Age-Associated Hallmarks by Partial Reprogramming](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674\(16\)31664-6)

&emsp;&emsp;This paper utilized a so-called "partial reprogramming" technique, which achieves localized reprogramming by cyclically and briefly inducing Yamanaka factors. Why must the induction be cyclic and brief? Because continuous induction of Yamanaka factor expression will cause tumors in living organisms. Recently, a paper published in _Stem Cell Reports_ also used this method:

[In Vivo Reprogramming Ameliorates Aging Features in Dentate Gyrus Cells and Improves Memory in Mice](https://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711\(20\)30385-4)

&emsp;&emsp;The authors of this paper reversed brain aging in mice by cyclically and briefly inducing Yamanaka factors to reprogram the mouse brain (specifically, by using tetracycline to induce the expression of Yamanaka factor genes in transgenic mice).

&emsp;&emsp;Cyclically and briefly inducing Yamanaka factors requires careful control. Overexpression can cause tumors, while insufficient expression yields poor anti-aging results. Is there a safe and highly controllable method? The Harvard Medical School team's paper found a solution to this problem: expressing only three factors—Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK)—can reverse epigenetic age without causing tumors. The experiment in this paper was highly successful. By utilizing AAV to overexpress the three OSK Yamanaka factors, the gene expression of older mice was restored to a level quite similar to that of young mice, and nerve regeneration was induced (in a sense, the mice were rejuvenated).

&emsp;&emsp;In June 2021, BioViva published the results of a delayed-aging research project initiated in 2018 on the non-peer-reviewed preprint website bioRxiv. They claimed to have demonstrated for the first time that Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can extend the lifespan of mice via intranasal delivery or injection as a form of gene therapy.

&emsp;&emsp;Researchers stated that the average lifespan of mice carrying mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) with exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or MCMVFST) was extended by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively.

&emsp;&emsp;This is the result of overexpressing just a single gene, TERT or FST, yet the life-extending effect is so pronounced. Based on genetic studies of long-lived animals, we know that a long-lived species typically possesses multiple anti-aging genes. From this, we can reasonably deduce: if we overexpress multiple anti-aging genes simultaneously, it might be possible to drastically extend lifespan.

&emsp;&emsp;The advantageous genes for longevity were formed slowly over a long evolutionary process. On this blue planet, no other species has ever understood the secrets of genes like humans do. In today's era, we have initially mastered the technology to regulate genes. In recent years, gene therapy technology has been developing rapidly, especially with the COVID-19 pandemic bringing nucleic acid drugs into the spotlight for the public and investors. In the near future, we may be able to become healthier and live much longer by regulating our genes.
