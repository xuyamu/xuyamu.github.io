  　A paper published in JAMA Psychiatry, _How COVID-19 Affects the Brain_, points out that follow-ups conducted in Germany and the UK found that 20% to 70% of patients (even young adults) experienced neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPs) post-COVID-19. These symptoms persisted for months after respiratory symptoms resolved, indicating ongoing brain involvement. SARS-CoV-2 enters via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and can damage endothelial cells, leading to inflammation, thrombosis, and brain injury. Furthermore, systemic inflammation causes a decrease in monoamines and trophic factors, as well as microglial activation, which leads to an increase in glutamate and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and subsequent excitotoxicity. The article mentions that interventions can be guided by corresponding mechanisms to reduce long-term NPs.

　　A paper published in _Cell_ in July 2022, _Mild respiratory COVID can cause multi-lineage neural cell and myelin dysregulation_, details the impact of COVID-19 infection on neurons. This paper indicates that even mild SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause persistent impairment of hippocampal neurogenesis, a decrease in oligodendrocytes, and significant myelin loss, along with elevated CSF cytokines/chemokines (including CCL11).

　　Researchers examined circulating CCL11 cytokine levels in the plasma of long COVID patients with and without cognitive symptoms. These individuals primarily experienced a relatively mild course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with over 90% of the subjects not requiring hospitalization. They found that compared to those without long COVID, individuals with long COVID who exhibited cognitive deficits or "brain fog" (n = 48 subjects, 16 males/32 females, mean age 46.1 ± 14.6 years) had elevated CCL11 levels in their plasma.

　　The study _Morphological, cellular, and molecular basis of brain infection in COVID-19 patients_ discovered that mildly infected COVID-19 patients experienced symptoms such as orbitofrontal cortex atrophy, neurocognitive impairment, excessive fatigue, and anxiety. In contrast, the genetic material of the virus was present in the brains of patients with severe acute infections (discovered through post-mortem tissue extraction studies).

　　In summary, we know that the mechanisms by which COVID-19 causes "brain fog" lie in the occurrence of inflammation, elevated levels of certain cytokines, and brain damage (atrophy). So, what small molecule drugs or dietary supplements have the potential to improve this? Below are some promising components I found based on literature and personal long-term use experience:

**Lithium Salts**

　　Anti-aging:

　　Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates the addition of phosphate molecules to serine and threonine amino acid residues. In mammals, including humans, GSK-3 exists in two isozymes encoded by two homologous genes, GSK-3α (GSK3A) and GSK-3β (GSK3B). GSK-3 has been the subject of numerous studies because it is implicated in a variety of diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, cancer, addiction, and bipolar disorder.

　　According to the paper _A triple drug combination targeting components of the nutrient-sensing network maximizes longevity_, rapamycin treatment leads to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in patients and mice, a disorder that manifests as hypertriglyceridemia in fruit flies. Lithium reversed this as well as the starvation resistance associated with rapamycin treatment. In this study, dual combinations of lithium and rapamycin, lithium and trametinib, or rapamycin and trametinib extended the average lifespan by 30% compared to the control group, whereas each compound alone extended the average lifespan by 11%. The triple combination extended it by 48%. Additionally, fruit flies given lithium showed increased fertility.

　　The 2023 paper _Lithium treatment extends human lifespan: findings from the UK Biobank_ points out: "Recent studies have shown that lithium supplementation can extend healthspan and lifespan in various animal models. Furthermore, nutritional lithium intake from drinking water has repeatedly been found to be positively correlated with human lifespan. By analyzing a large observational aging cohort (UK Biobank, n = 501,461 individuals) alongside prescription data from the National Health Service (NHS), we found here that therapeutic lithium supplementation is associated with reduced mortality in patients diagnosed with affective disorders. Subsequent multivariable survival analyses showed that lithium was the strongest factor contributing to the survival-increasing effect."

　　Neuroprotection:

　　The review _Review of lithium effects on brain and blood_ points out: "In animals, lithium upregulates neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor, neurotrophin-3 (NT3), and the receptors for these growth factors in the brain. Lithium also stimulates the proliferation of stem cells, including bone marrow and neural stem cells in the subventricular zone, striatum, and forebrain. The stimulation of endogenous neural stem cells may explain why lithium increases brain cell density and volume in patients with bipolar disorder."

　　Antiviral:

　　Studies have found that GSK-3 inhibitors can simultaneously block SARs virus replication while enhancing CD8+ adaptive T cell and innate natural killer (NK) responses. Viral replication requires GSK-3 to phosphorylate critical serine residues of the SARs CoV1 N protein; therefore, small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of GSK-3 can inhibit viral replication. A retrospective analysis from the study _Targeting the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein through GSK-3 inhibition_, which looked at patients undergoing SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing across three major health systems, found that patients taking lithium had a significantly reduced risk of contracting COVID-19.

　　According to _Efficacy and Safety of Lithium Treatment in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients_, lithium can reduce the number of days hospitalized and admitted to the intensive care unit as well as the risk of death. By preventing cytokine storms, it lowers inflammatory cytokine levels and may also reduce long COVID syndrome.

　　Researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2020–002008–37) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium treatment in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical trial results showed that lithium treatment reduced the number of hospitalization days; the control group averaged 12.43 days (12.43 ± 12.09), while the lithium group averaged 6.47 days (6.47 ± 3.60) (Figure 1). Although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.17), it showed a clear trend toward reduced hospitalization days. None of the patients receiving lithium treatment required ICU admission, and none died. In contrast, in the control group, two patients were admitted to the ICU, and one patient died, as shown in the figure:

　　(The lithium salt commonly used in psychiatry is lithium carbonate, which requires a hospital prescription, while lithium orotate is commonly used as a dietary supplement and can be purchased on e-commerce platforms.)

**Luteolin**

　　Anti-aging:

　　Luteolin is an abundant flavonoid in the human diet. The paper _The Evaluation of Geroprotective Effects of Selected Flavonoids in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans_ notes: "Flavonoids are an intensely studied group of natural compounds that possess antioxidant, antitumoral, antihyperglycemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties." This paper found that luteolin can extend the lifespan of _Caenorhabditis elegans_ and female _Drosophila melanogaster_, demonstrating potential anti-aging effects.

　　Neuroprotection:

　　The paper _Dietary Luteolin Reduces Proinflammatory Microglia in the Brain of Senescent Mice_ mentions: "The flavonoid luteolin reduces neuroinflammation and improves learning and memory in aged mice." This study also found that a luteolin-supplemented diet inhibited microglial activity in the brain during adult aging and LPS activation, thereby suppressing neuroinflammation.

　　The neuroprotective effects of luteolin also include the suppression of fearful emotions. The study _Luteolin reduces fear, anxiety, and depression in rats with post-traumatic stress disorder_ showed that luteolin administration restored the increased norepinephrine and decreased serotonin levels in the fear circuitry, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampal structures of rats exposed to chronic stress, exhibiting antidepressant and anxiolytic effects.

　　Furthermore, the study _Long-COVID syndrome-associated brain fog and chemofog: Luteolin to the rescue_ indicates that luteolin has the potential to improve brain fog associated with long COVID. The symptoms of long-COVID syndrome, especially brain fog, are similar to those experienced by patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy, as well as those with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). The pathogenesis of brain fog in these diseases is currently unclear but may involve neuroinflammation, where mast cells are stimulated by pathogens and stress to release mediators that activate microglia and cause hypothalamic inflammation. These processes could be alleviated by phytosomal preparations of the natural flavonoid luteolin (in olive pomace oil).

　　Antiviral:

　　The interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is crucial for viral entry and subsequent replication. A study found that when luteolin binds to a previously unidentified distal binding site on the RBD, far from the RBD-ACE2 interface, it exhibits a strong allosteric effect, which could be a potential target for future drug discovery.

　　Additionally, among SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for viral genome replication and has become one of the most promising targets for drug intervention against SARS-CoV-2. The paper _Quercetin and luteolin are single-digit micromolar inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase_ found that both luteolin and quercetin possess the ability to inhibit the RdRp enzyme. Luteolin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with an IC50 of 4.6 ± 0.3 µM, while quercetin had an IC50 of 6.9 ± 1.0 µM.

　　(Luteolin is used as a dietary supplement abroad. Lianhua Qingwen contains quercetin and luteolin, though in small amounts.)

**Ibudilast**

　　MN-166 (ibudilast) is a small molecule compound that inhibits phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) and inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). It is in late-stage clinical development for treating neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), progressive MS (multiple sclerosis), and DCM (degenerative cervical myelopathy); it is also being developed to treat glioblastoma, CIPN (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), and substance use disorders.

　　As shown in the figure, ibudilast has both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.

　　**Treating COVID-19**

　　MediciNova's Phase 2 clinical trial of MN-166 (ibudilast) yielded positive top-line results in hospitalized COVID-19 patients at risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Compared to a placebo, MN-166 (ibudilast) showed significant improvement across all four clinical endpoints analyzed. (MediciNova is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a broad late-stage pipeline and novel small molecule therapies for inflammatory, fibrotic, and neurodegenerative diseases.)

　　According to relevant news, MediciNova is preparing to collaborate with the University Health Network (UHN), a Canadian academic health sciences center, to conduct clinical trials of ibudilast for long COVID. (Canada's University Health Network has the largest hospital research program in the country.)

　　**Anti-inflammatory**

　　According to _Early-Life Experience Decreases Drug-Induced Reinstatement of Morphine CPP in Adulthood via Microglial-Specific Epigenetic Programming of Anti-Inflammatory IL-10 Expression_, systemic treatment with the glial modulator ibudilast increased IL-10 expression within the NAcc and blocked morphine-induced glial activation.

　　As shown in the figure, pretreatment with the glial inhibitor ibudilast 30 minutes prior to morphine administration significantly attenuated the expression of all 10 cytokines and chemokines within the NAcc induced by morphine. As discussed earlier, CCL11 cytokine levels rise in the blood of brain fog patients, and ibudilast has the potential to lower CCL11.

　　**Neuroprotection**

　　Ibudilast also shows potential for treating Alzheimer's disease. According to _Multi-scale predictive modeling discovers Ibudilast as a polypharmacological agent to improve hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory and mitigate plaque and tangle pathology in a transgenic rat model of Alzheimer’s disease_, transgenic rats treated with ibudilast exhibited better cognitive abilities and fewer AD pathological hallmarks. RNA sequencing analysis in the hippocampus revealed that ibudilast affected the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in the TLR signaling pathway. This study identified ibudilast as a potential therapeutic that could be repurposed to reduce neuroinflammation in AD by targeting TLR signal transduction.

　　The study _Effects of Ibudilast on MRI Measures in the Phase 2 SPRINT-MS Study_ showed that ibudilast can slow brain volume atrophy in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS).
