&emsp;&emsp;Almost all animals inevitably face the end of death; why is the length of life limited? Why do some animals live long while others have short lifespans? This article will analyze the genes of long-lived animals to explain the reasons for the differences in animal lifespans from a genetic perspective.

&emsp;&emsp;There is a pattern in the lifespan of mammals: the larger the body weight, the longer the lifespan. The reason may be related to the basal metabolic rate. Here is a graph illustrating the correlation between body weight and lifespan:

&emsp;&emsp;As shown in the figure, the relative lifespans of humans, naked mole rats, and little brown bats are relatively long.

**Brandt's Bat**

&emsp;&emsp;The COVID-19 pandemic and speculations about the COVID-19 virus originating from bats have drawn people's attention to these animals. Bats have a powerful immune system that allows them to coexist with various viruses. Bats also have a fascinating phenomenon—they are generally long-lived. Among them, mouse-eared bats (genus _Myotis_) are standouts, and the Brandt's bat (_Myotis brandti_) within this genus can live for more than 40 years (the longest-lived Brandt's bat discovered so far is 41 years old, and this bat was wild) and rarely gets cancer. We know that small mammals usually have shorter lifespans than larger mammals. Brandt's bats are very small, only 33~37 mm long and weighing only 7~8 g. Laboratory mice, which are commonly used, weigh about 20 g and are slightly larger than Brandt's bats, yet their lifespan is only 2~3 years. Among known mammals, only 19 species have longer lifespans relative to humans (considering body size), including the naked mole rat and 18 species of bats. Relative to its body weight, the Brandt's bat is the longest-lived mammal known.

&emsp;&emsp;What is the reason for the longevity of mouse-eared bats? Genetic research on mouse-eared bats has revealed the mechanisms of their longevity. I have divided the known main mechanisms into four aspects:

1. Mutations in IGF-1 receptor and growth hormone receptor genes:
    
&emsp;&emsp;Research has found that mutations in the IGF-1 receptor and growth hormone receptor genes of Brandt's bats lead to functional impairment. If the same mutations occurred in humans, it would lead to dwarfism, which can explain why Brandt's bats are so tiny. Studies on human dwarfism patients show that they are less prone to diabetes and cancer. Studies on _Caenorhabditis elegans_ (nematodes) found that those carrying loss-of-function mutations in DAF-2/IGF-1 receptors and the TOR effector protein RKS-1/S6K can significantly extend their lifespan (up to five times longer). The functional impairment of IGF-1 receptors and growth hormone receptors may be an important reason for the longevity of Brandt's bats.

2. Powerful DNA repair ability:
    
&emsp;&emsp;Studies have found that mouse-eared bats have higher expressions of ATM and SETX, two genes involved in gene repair capabilities. ATM is the master switch molecule that directly senses DNA double-strand breaks and initiates numerous DNA damage signal response pathways. Mutations in the ATM gene can lead to ataxia telangiectasia and increase the risk of cancer. Previous studies have found that enhancing ATM activity can delay aging in premature aging mouse models and extend their lifespan. Meanwhile, missense mutations in SETX can lead to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

3. Powerful ability to maintain telomere length:
    
&emsp;&emsp;We know that for the vast majority of mammals, including humans, telomeres shorten as cells divide. As we age, our telomeres get shorter and shorter. However, according to research on the correlation between telomere length and age in mouse-eared bats, their telomere length does not decrease with age. Studies have found that mouse-eared bats do not exhibit higher telomerase activity, but the expression levels of ATM, MRE11a, RAD50, and WRN—genes associated with the "alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)" mechanism—are relatively high. For most mammals, the ALT mechanism only appears in abnormal situations, such as in cancer cells. Yet, mouse-eared bats seem to be able to activate the ALT mechanism under normal conditions, preventing their telomeres from shortening.

4. Differential expression of anti-aging related miRNAs:
    
&emsp;&emsp;Research on miRNAs in the blood of mouse-eared bats found that the expression of some miRNAs related to aging and cancer in mouse-eared bats is different from other mammals. For example, mouse-eared bats highly express miR-101, miR-16, and miR-143, which have tumor-suppressive functions, and highly express miR-155, which can upregulate NRF2 function. NRF2 has the effect of combating oxidative stress.

**Naked Mole Rat**

&emsp;&emsp;The naked mole rat (_Heterocephalus glaber_) is another mammal famous for its longevity. This ugly animal is about the size of a rat, but its lifespan of up to thirty years is ten times that of a rat. They age slowly and rarely get cancer, making them a popular research subject in the aging field. So, what advantageous genes do naked mole rats possess? Research has found:

1. Telomere-related gene advantages
    
&emsp;&emsp;Naked mole rats possess a positive selection advantage in three telomere-related genes: TOP2A, TEP1, and TERF1. These three genes are part of the five protein complexes associated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway. Studies have also found a special amino acid variation in the TRF1 gene (telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 gene) of the naked mole rat, which enables the naked mole rat's TRF1 protein to bind to telomeres more strongly and maintain them better. It is known that TRF1 decreases with age, and overexpressing TRF1 can delay aging. The mutation in the TRF1 gene may be one of the factors for the naked mole rat's longevity. Interestingly, the TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) gene of the naked mole rat can still be stably expressed as it ages. Multiple studies have shown that the telomeres of naked mole rats are relatively stable and do not shorten with age.

2. Gene expression trends conducive to longevity
    
&emsp;&emsp;Research has found that the expression of some genes in humans changes with age, whereas the expression of corresponding genes in naked mole rats is relatively stable. Some gene changes are even reversed. For example, in humans, the genes CYP46A1 and SMAD3 decrease with age, but in naked mole rats, they increase with age. The product of the CYP46A1 gene is a mediator of cholesterol homeostasis, affecting the β-aggregation trend of cholesterol. The product of SMAD3 is a regulator of TGF-β signaling, which plays a role in cancer development by slowing down cell proliferation. The high expression of SMAD3 in naked mole rats during aging may help optimize cell mortality and protect them from cancer invasion. Genes related to macromolecular degradation, such as GSTA1, DERL1, and GNS, do not increase with age in naked mole rats. Genes related to mitochondrial proteins, such as NDUFB11, ATP5G3, and UQCRQ, do not decrease with age, which may help maintain mitochondrial function in naked mole rats.

3. Stronger DNA repair ability and related genes
    

&emsp;&emsp;A study on the DNA repair ability of naked mole rats and mice showed that naked mole rats have a more efficient excision repair capacity. Another study on the DNA repair ability of 18 rodent species showed that relatively long-lived rodents like naked mole rats and beavers have stronger DNA repair abilities, which is related to their SIRT6 activity, and human SIRT6 activity is stronger than that of short-lived animals like mice.

4. Powerful anti-cancer ability and related genes
    
&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned earlier, the cancer-related gene expressions in naked mole rats are conducive to fighting cancer. In 2020, a study found that the half-life of the p53 protein in naked mole rat embryonic fibroblasts (NEFs) is more than 10 times that of the p53 protein in mouse and human embryonic fibroblasts. This research suggests that the unique stability and regulation of the p53 protein may contribute to the naked mole rat's remarkable resistance to cancer. This study also noted that phylogenetic analysis showed the naked mole rat's genome contains 17 pseudogene copies of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which may be one of the reasons for its excellent anti-cancer abilities.

**Bowhead Whale**

&emsp;&emsp;The bowhead whale (_Balaena mysticetus_) is a long-lived large marine mammal. They have huge heads and uniquely shaped arched lower jaws. They live in the cold waters of the Northern Hemisphere, and their lifespans can exceed two hundred years, making them the longest-lived mammal known. What genetic advantages do bowhead whales have that make them live so long?

&emsp;&emsp;A comparative genomic positive selection analysis (dN/dS) study on bowhead whales and minke whales showed that bowhead whales have a positive selection advantage in the following genes:

&emsp;&emsp;Suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2), aprataxin (APTX), noggin (NOG), and leptin (LEP). Compared to the bottlenose dolphin, the genes in the top 5% of positive selection value include:

&emsp;&emsp;Forkhead box O transcription factor (FOXO3) gene, excision repair cross-complementation group 3 (ERCC3) gene, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene.

&emsp;&emsp;The suppressor of cytokine signaling is a member of the SOCS family, involved in regulating many physiological processes, including individual growth, metabolism, bone formation, tumorigenesis, and bodily immunity. FOXO3 is a famous longevity gene. When the body is under oxidative stress, FOXO3 is modified and enters the cell nucleus, initiating the expression of genes related to the oxidative stress response, thereby protecting cells from stress damage. The excision repair cross-complementation (ERCC) gene family plays a crucial role in the DNA self-repair process.

&emsp;&emsp;To identify amino acid variations specific to bowhead whale proteins, this study conducted a homologous sequence comparison between the bowhead whale and nine other mammals. Lineage-specific residues identified in this way have previously been shown to be indicative of significant changes in protein function. This analysis revealed several proteins associated with aging and cancer, including excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). We have already mentioned the role of the excision repair cross-complementation (ERCC) gene family, while histone deacetylases play an important role in chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation.

2025 Supplement:

&emsp;&emsp;A new study in 2024 showed that compared to other mammals, bowhead whale cells have a higher efficiency and accuracy in repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) and mismatches. The level of the CIRBP protein, which is related to protection against genotoxic stress, is much higher in bowhead whales than in other mammals. Moreover, CIRBP and its downstream protein RPA2 (which is also present at high levels in bowhead whale cells) can improve the efficiency and fidelity of DNA repair in human cells.

**Giant Tortoise**

&emsp;&emsp;The Galapagos giant tortoise is one of the longest-lived vertebrates. The lifespans of these massive and heavy land tortoises can exceed a hundred years. In 2012, a Galapagos giant tortoise named Lonesome George passed away. From his discovery in 1971 until his confirmed death in 2012, he was considered the last known individual of the Pinta Island tortoise (_Geochelone nigra abingdoni_). The death of Lonesome George marked the extinction of the Pinta Island tortoise.

&emsp;&emsp;A genetic study on Lonesome George was published in 2019. This study used genetic samples from Lonesome George and another Aldabra giant tortoise (_Aldabrachelys gigantea_) to compare with other species and discovered a series of lineage-specific variants affecting DNA repair genes, inflammatory mediators, and genes related to cancer development. Specifically, they include:

DNA maintenance related genes: GAPDH gene, NEIL1 gene, RMI2 gene, and XRCC6 gene, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;Tumor suppression related genes: SMAD4 gene, NF2 gene, PML gene, PTPN11 gene, and P2RY8 gene, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;Telomere maintenance related genes: DCLRE1B gene and TERF2 gene, etc.

&emsp;&emsp;Other anti-aging genes: EEF1A1 gene, etc.

**Centenarians**

&emsp;&emsp;It is worth mentioning that a whole-genome sequencing analysis study on centenarians published in May 2021 found that, compared to ordinary elderly people, the genes of long-lived elderly people over 105 years old give them stronger DNA repair capabilities, a stronger ability to combat reactive oxygen species, and better mitochondrial function.

**Comprehensive Analysis**

&emsp;&emsp;Based on the above studies of different long-lived animals, it is easy to see that long-lived animals generally share the following commonalities:

&emsp;&emsp;Powerful telomere maintenance function, powerful DNA repair ability, and powerful anti-cancer ability. Why are these three major factors related to lifespan? Let's look at how these three factors affect lifespan:

&emsp;&emsp;Telomeres are special structures at the ends of chromosomes in eukaryotic cells. Every time a cell divides, the telomere shortens a bit. When the telomere shortens to a certain extent, the cell will lose its ability to divide. Maintaining telomere integrity is very important for cell survival, so to live a long life, the telomere maintenance ability must be strong. This may explain why telomere-related genes in long-lived animals generally have a positive selection advantage. As animals develop and grow, DNA faces the risk of damage due to various internal factors (mitochondria producing reactive oxygen free radicals that damage DNA) and external factors (various toxic molecules entering the body and destroying DNA). DNA mutations can cause various problems such as telomere shortening, cellular senescence, apoptosis, and cancer. Therefore, DNA repair ability is crucial for animals to maintain a healthy body. If an animal gets cancer, it will die quickly, so to live long, the anti-cancer ability must be strong.

&emsp;&emsp;The advantages of longevity genes are slowly formed over a long evolutionary process. On this blue planet, no species has ever known the secrets of genes like humans do. In today's era, we have initially mastered the technology to regulate genes. In recent years, gene therapy technology has been developing rapidly, especially the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought nucleic acid drugs into the view of the public and investors. In the near future, we may be able to make ourselves healthier and longer-lived by regulating genes.
