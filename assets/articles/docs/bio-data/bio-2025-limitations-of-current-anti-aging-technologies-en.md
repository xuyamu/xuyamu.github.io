  Currently, mainstream anti-aging technologies include at least three major categories:

**I. Natural Methods**

  Exercise and caloric restriction are two traditional and effective non-technological approaches.

  1. Exercise. It is common knowledge that moderate exercise is beneficial to health and extends lifespan. However, some sports may actually be detrimental to longevity. A relatively recent study, "Sport and longevity: an observational study of international athletes," found that among male athletes, pole vaulting and gymnastics had the highest correlation with increased lifespan, while volleyball and sumo wrestling showed the strongest negative correlation. Among males, cricket, rowing, baseball, water polo, Australian rules football, Irish hurling, lacrosse, and field hockey were positively correlated with lifespan, whereas rugby, canoeing and kayaking, basketball, American football, and soccer were negatively correlated with lifespan, alongside handball and volleyball. Racket sports consistently showed a positive correlation for both male and female athletes, potentially extending the lifespan of male athletes by up to 5.7 years and female athletes by up to 2.8 years.

  2. Caloric restriction. Caloric restriction is a hot topic in the anti-aging field. It has demonstrated life-extending effects in various animal models, and the primary mechanism by which it regulates lifespan lies in the activation of FoxO and AMPK. The study "Dietary restriction impacts health and lifespan of genetically diverse mice" analyzed the effects of different degrees of caloric restriction on the lifespan of mice. The research found that both caloric restriction and intermittent fasting can extend lifespan, and the extent of the extension is proportional to the degree of restriction. A 40% caloric restriction showed the strongest life-extending effect, but it also led to weight loss and immune system changes, potentially making the subjects more susceptible to infections.

  The life-extending magnitude of both methods mentioned above is limited. We cannot rely solely on exercise and caloric restriction to live to 200 years old. If we want to significantly extend our lifespan, we need to bring in some advanced technology and hardcore science!

**II. Small Molecule Interventions**

  Currently, the popular anti-aging drugs and supplements in the anti-aging community primarily belong to small molecule compounds. Using small molecules to intervene in aging currently has at least the following limitations:

  1. Limited efficacy of single small molecule interventions. Most current research on anti-aging small molecules focuses on the anti-aging or life-extending effects of a specific small molecule. However, the effect of intervening with a single small molecule is limited; even for the more effective ones, the lifespan extension mostly falls within the 10% to 20% range. If we want to live to 200, it is impossible to rely on taking just one type of small molecule compound.

  2. Various combinations of small molecules remain to be explored. There are already some studies on combinations of multiple small molecules. For instance, in the paper "Chemically induced reprogramming to reverse cellular aging", the combination VC6TF was identified as the core component for reversing aging. VC6TF stands for: V: Valproic acid; C: CHIR99021; 6: E-616452 (RepSox); T: Tranylcypromine; F: Forskolin. This combination was also tested independently alongside Rapamycin and TTNPB, but the results were mediocre. It is possible that the aging-reversal effect of this combination is already so strong that adding Rapamycin and TTNPB offers no additional benefits. However, sodium butyrate and α-ketoglutarate did show an enhancing effect in another cocktail combination. Through this experiment, we can see that more small molecules are not necessarily better, likely because many small molecules have overlapping functions. If two small molecules share the same life-extending pathway, using them together will not achieve a 1+1>2 effect.

  By the way, I led a fruit fly experiment testing the life-extending effects of various epigenetic-regulating small molecules (including CHIR99021, RepSox, Tranylcypromine, Forskolin, etc.) used individually and in combination. We also found that simply adding more small molecules is not better; there seems to be a ceiling effect. For example, we found that RepSox, Tranylcypromine, and Forskolin had very good life-extending effects when used individually. When we fed fruit flies nine different small molecules simultaneously, we found it was not much better than using them alone, indicating a ceiling effect. (The data for this experiment wasn't very robust; I felt it wouldn't make it into a Q1 journal, so I lost the desire to publish it.) After the fruit fly experiments confirmed that these small molecule combinations could extend lifespan, I started taking a combination of multiple epigenetic regulators in 2022 (I initially started with sodium phenylbutyrate, CHIR99021, RepSox, and Forskolin, and later switched to VC6TF. At that time, the paper "Chemically induced reprogramming to reverse cellular aging" had not yet been published—great minds think alike, I suppose). I found that these combinations of epigenetic regulators had a profound impact on physiological markers and could significantly reverse biological age, giving me a physical sensation of rejuvenation. For example, it made my thoughts flow like a fountain and restored the inspiration of my youth; my hearing and emotions also became more sensitive. Overall, I was deeply moved after taking this combination! Moved by the fact that I could regain my youth! The fact that I can easily write tens of thousands of words on Zhihu in recent years can be attributed to the anti-aging effects of these epigenetic regulators. Please note that taking VC6TF requires a variety of adjuvant drugs to offset side effects, and there are many precautions to consider; those who do not fully understand it should not take it on their own.

  3. Intervening in specific targets may produce severe side effects. Some well-known anti-aging small molecules have significant side effects. For instance, the famous Rapamycin has considerable adverse reactions because it inhibits cell proliferation. Although some anti-aging small molecules can extend lifespan by intervening in a specific target, they can also produce unwanted side effects. In the future, we need to develop anti-aging small molecules that target even more precise pathways to achieve life extension with low side effects. Why does intervening in certain targets extend lifespan but cause severe side effects? Some possible mechanisms include:

  ① Activating FoxO is a common way to extend lifespan, but some methods of activating FoxO come with side effects. Caloric restriction and many FoxO-activating compounds work by inhibiting Akt to activate FoxO, which in turn causes an increase in GSK-3β. This attribute of the Akt pathway might be designed to cope with harsh environments. For example, under conditions like starvation, cell proliferation is not a good thing as it consumes a massive amount of energy. During starvation, the animal body not only does not need to proliferate cells but also needs to actively reduce cells to cut costs and save resources. Therefore, when starvation inhibits the Akt pathway, cells stop proliferating and some undergo apoptosis, thereby achieving energy conservation. However, we activate FoxO for the anti-aging and life-extending benefits, not to save energy due to a lack of food. Consequently, we want both the benefits of FoxO for longevity and cell proliferation (to obtain a body full of energy, a robust physique, and vigorous fertility). This requires a much finer regulation of cellular signaling pathways. Naturally, this "having your cake and eating it too" scenario is very difficult to achieve. Fortunately, we have cell biology and small molecule compounds used to regulate cellular signaling pathways, which allows us to manipulate cell survival, proliferation, aging, and apoptosis, thereby fundamentally changing our biological destiny.

  ② Under natural conditions, the epigenetic clock is difficult to reverse or slow down, and doing so produces side effects. If the epigenetic clock could be easily reversed in nature, developmental processes would frequently be disrupted. To ensure an individual successfully develops from a fertilized egg to sexual maturity and produces offspring to continue their genes, the epigenetic clock must ensure forward movement. This leads to an "you can't have both" situation. Naturally, you cannot maintain the self-renewal ability of stem cells to allow symmetrical division (one stem cell dividing into two) while simultaneously promoting their differentiation into somatic cells. From the perspective of cellular signaling pathways, this is because to maintain stem cell self-renewal, you must elevate Nanog levels, which requires inhibiting the ubiquitination and degradation of Nanog. ERK can phosphorylate the S539 site of USP21, weakening the interaction between USP21 and Nanog, thereby accelerating Nanog degradation. Currently, a core pathway of reprogramming is to inhibit ERK, thereby inhibiting Nanog degradation. However, inhibiting ERK also inhibits cell proliferation. Under natural conditions, caloric restriction inhibits cell proliferation through the insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/ERK pathway, which elevates Nanog levels, but your cells stop proliferating as a result. If you want to develop and grow, you need cell proliferation. Thus, development and differentiation are accompanied by the weakening of stem cell self-renewal capabilities, ultimately leading to stem cell exhaustion (one of the hallmarks of aging). Therefore, under natural conditions, we are inevitably "born to die"; this is one of the fundamental causes of aging. However, we can achieve a "win-win" scenario and alter our destiny through the precise regulation of cellular signaling pathways, gene expression, and protein levels.

  4. There are still many targets without corresponding small molecules. Currently, many known aging-related targets do not have corresponding small molecules for direct intervention. Although some targets can be indirectly affected by certain small molecules, there are potential side effects. For example, the commonly used antimalarial and antirheumatic drug chloroquine can activate ATM, but chloroquine has severe side effects.

  Future Directions:

  5. Finer regulation of gene or protein levels using small molecules. In my article "Analysis of Advantageous Genes in Long-Lived Animals", I discussed the advantageous genes possessed by long-lived animals. Knowing which genes are beneficial for longevity, we might be able to extend lifespan by using small molecules to precisely regulate the expression of specific genes or protein levels. For instance, the long-lived Myotis bats have higher expression of ATM and SETX. Could we increase the expression of ATM and SETX genes, or could we elevate ATM and SETX protein levels/activity? How can we achieve this with small molecules? One possible method is to alter the levels of relevant transcription factors for longevity genes. Transcription factors are proteins that bind to specific nucleotide sequences upstream of a gene and regulate its transcription. Some transcription factors can upregulate their target gene expression, while others repress it. For example, TERT has a series of transcription factors that can enhance its expression, as well as a series that can inhibit it, as shown in the figure below:

<figure>     <img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-hTERT-promoter.webp">     <figcaption>(Image source: Roles of telomeres and telomerase in cancer, and advances in telomerase-targeted therapies)</figcaption> </figure>

  As shown in the image above, we can see that WT1 can inhibit TERT transcription; perhaps we could try to capitalize on this. Of course, the effects of WT1 on its other target genes and the side effects of inhibiting WT1 must also be comprehensively considered. Regardless, this is a great R&D approach: we can investigate which transcription factors are related to aging and intervene in the aging process by regulating their levels or activity. Many transcription factors have been discovered to be associated with aging, such as reprogramming-related transcription factors (Yamanaka factors, Nanog, etc.), and Nrf2 is also a famous aging-related transcription factor. Nrf2 is closely related to oxidative stress and can regulate cellular inflammatory responses. Common dietary supplements like sulforaphane and ergothioneine exert their anti-aging effects by activating Nrf2.

  To regulate protein levels, we can alter them by interfering with their ubiquitination. Increasing protein ubiquitination accelerates protein degradation, while decreasing it can inhibit degradation. RepSox, commonly used in reprogramming, works by inhibiting the TGF-β/ERK pathway to prevent the ubiquitination and degradation of Nanog, thereby enhancing the self-renewal capacity of stem cells and laying the foundation for reprogramming. However, inhibiting ERK suppresses cell proliferation, leading to adverse reactions. If we could directly increase Nanog levels or its activity, we could directly boost stem cell self-renewal without inhibiting cell proliferation. Furthermore, small molecule compounds can affect protein activity by altering protein conformation. If we already know a certain protein helps extend lifespan, we can enhance its activity; conversely, if we know a protein shortens lifespan, we can reduce its activity.

  2. Develop more small molecule compounds targeting anti-aging pathways. Many lifespan-related targets have been discovered, but numerous targets currently lack any targeting small molecules. In the future, we can unlock the potential of small molecules for life extension by developing more compounds directed at anti-aging targets.

  An example of an R&D direction: developing small molecules to enhance DNA repair capabilities. The bowhead whale is the longest-lived mammal. Recent studies have found that, compared to human, cow, and mouse cells, bowhead whale cells contain higher levels of the CIRBP protein, which improves DNA repair efficiency. I previously studied the structure of CIRBP. The figure below shows the structure of CIRBP (predicted using AlphaFold), potential (small molecule) binding pockets, and a potential Degron sequence (a sequence that regulates the substrate's ubiquitination-degradation pathway) found through prediction and analysis. Using software prediction, I identified BTRC as the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase for CIRBP. Preventing the binding of CIRBP to BTRC could reduce its ubiquitination and degradation. However, the difficulty lies in the fact that BTRC is not specific to CIRBP.

Preventing the binding of CIRBP to BTRC can reduce its ubiquitination and degradation, but the difficulty lies in the fact that BTRC is not specific to CIRBP.</figcaption> </figure>

  Enhancing CIRBP activity is another approach. CIRBP stands for Cold-Inducible RNA-Binding Protein. As the name suggests, it is a protein that binds to RNA. The RRM domain of CIRBP functions by binding to the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) or 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of specific mRNA molecules. If we can find an allosteric site where a small molecule can bind and induce a conformational change, thereby enhancing the affinity of the RRM for RNA, we could increase CIRBP activity.

**III. Gene Therapy**

  (The author has previously designed gene therapy vectors such as lentiviruses and plasmids for cellular experiments and published an SCI Q1 paper on the subject.)

  Gene therapy refers to a method of using macromolecular nucleic acid drugs to alter gene expression for therapeutic purposes. The goals of gene therapy include increasing gene expression (using mRNA, AAV, adenoviruses, lentiviruses, etc., to upregulate specific genes) and decreasing gene expression (using shRNA, etc., to downregulate specific genes). The advantage of gene therapy is its clear targeting.

  Currently, gene therapy has several limitations:

  1. High costs. Gene therapy drugs already on the market can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, making them extremely expensive to use. Why is gene therapy so expensive? On one hand, producing gene therapy drugs is costly (for example, AAV packaging requires cell culture technology). On the other hand, current gene therapy drugs target rare diseases; with a small audience, they naturally cannot rely on small profit margins and high sales volume to spread out R&D costs.

  2. Risks of off-target effects and gene alteration. AAV, a commonly used virus in gene therapy, is frequently used clinically due to its low immunogenicity. Its design purpose is not to alter the user's genes, but there is still an integration risk. The experimental results presented in the study "AAV Vectors Containing rDNA Homology Display Increased Chromosomal Integration and Transgene Persistence" showed that even at low vector doses, rAAV vectors achieved an integration rate of 1/1000. For anti-aging purposes, altering the genes of the individual receiving gene therapy carries potential risks: on one hand, it could cause cancer; on the other hand, if the therapeutic gene aims to reverse epigenetics to combat aging, its long-term expression could affect fertility (by altering the epigenetics of the embryo, thereby affecting embryonic development). Although messenger RNA (mRNA) will not integrate into the genome, it degrades quickly and cannot achieve long-term expression. Gene therapy drugs must be injected; using mRNA for gene therapy would require frequent injections, which is inconvenient and highly expensive.

  In summary, using gene therapy for anti-aging is currently expensive, risky, and lacks universal applicability.

  Appendix: A researcher's mindset influences their research direction. I previously attended an anti-aging conference and found that the attending scholars rarely pondered the essence of aging or how to break the limits of lifespan extension. Most merely studied the anti-aging effects of a specific drug. I've seen too much of this kind of research, and it simply isn't enough. What I want are new methods and new approaches—innovations capable of shattering current life-extension barriers. My goal is to significantly extend lifespan; for example, setting a small goal to live to two hundred! If a scholar only wants to extend lifespan by 20%, they easily fall into a fixed mindset, eager to pursue research that cannot break existing limits, like studying the life-extending effects of Rapamycin. No matter how much you study Rapamycin's effects, it will never allow someone to live to two hundred. To reach two hundred, we need a multi-pronged approach, such as improving DNA repair capabilities, lengthening telomeres, and enhancing anti-cancer abilities. We must develop new targets, and we must grasp the fundamental essence of aging to precisely regulate the aging process.
