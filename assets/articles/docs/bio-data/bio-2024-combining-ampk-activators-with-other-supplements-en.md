  There is a massive pitfall in anti-aging supplements: functional conflicts exist between certain well-known anti-aging supplements and others. Both beginner and veteran anti-aging enthusiasts might simultaneously take two conflicting supplements, resulting in diminished efficacy.

  There are two highly popular categories in the anti-aging community: AMPK activators and antioxidants.

  **AMPK Activators**

  5' AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK, or 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular energy homeostasis. It is primarily activated when cellular energy is deficient or when exposed to harsh environments such as oxidative stress, thereby altering the uptake and oxidation of glucose and fatty acids. The net effect of AMPK activation includes stimulating hepatic fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake, while inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis. It also inhibits adipocyte lipogenesis and lipolysis, and modulates insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells. The AMPK pathway is a conserved biological self-preservation mechanism. In nature, when the AMPK pathway is activated, the organism is often in harsh conditions (such as starvation, energy depletion, or oxidative stress). At this time, to prolong life, the organism activates AMPK to initiate self-preservation mechanisms, which ultimately extends lifespan.

  Natural activation methods: Caloric restriction and aerobic exercise. Caloric restriction activates AMPK by increasing the AMP/ATP ratio, while aerobic exercise activates AMPK by both increasing the AMP/ATP ratio and generating ROS.

  Besides caloric restriction and exercise, many anti-aging supplements exert their effects by activating AMPK. Based on their activation pathways, they can be categorized as follows:

  ATP-reducing class: Simulates caloric restriction by increasing the AMP/ATP ratio. Representatives include Metformin, Quercetin, Resveratrol, and Berberine.

  ROS-elevating class: EGCG, Baicalein, Dihydromyricetin, Luteolin, Chloroquine, Tetramethylpyrazine, and Ginsenosides.

  In addition, hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, and radiation can also promote longevity at specific dosages.

  cAMP-elevating class: Forskolin.

  Plant flavonoids and saponins are very common anti-aging supplements both domestically and internationally. Many beginner enthusiasts have at least one or two plant extracts on hand. Most natural AMPK activators stimulate AMPK through either reducing ATP or increasing ROS, and this is exactly where the problem lies. When AMPK activators that work by increasing ROS coexist with antioxidants like NAC that directly scavenge ROS, the antioxidants will rapidly neutralize the ROS. This causes the ROS-elevating AMPK activators to become ineffective. A related paper states:

  Theanine Improves High-Dose Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate-Induced Lifespan Reduction in Caenorhabditis elegans. Experiments in this paper found:

> In C. elegans, the mechanism by which 200 μM EGCG extends lifespan is stimulated by induced ROS [39]. In previous studies, we found that the lifespan-extending effect induced by low-dose EGCG was eliminated by the administration of the antioxidant NAC [9]. In our study, the lifespan reduction caused by the excessive increase in ROS levels induced by 1000 μM EGCG is similar to the lifespan reduction induced by high concentrations of oxidants [20,21].

  EGCG is an oxidation inducer, so why is it often sold as an antioxidant? (Various plant flavonoid AMPK activators are also frequently referred to as antioxidants.) This involves the Nrf2 pathway, which controls the basal and induced expression of a series of antioxidant response element-dependent genes. Once activated, AMPK can exert an antioxidant effect by activating the Nrf2 pathway. Therefore, EGCG acts as an antioxidant by activating the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway in a pro-oxidant manner. So, in reality, EGCG's activation of AMPK is short-term; once ROS is cleared, AMPK is no longer activated. This AMPK mechanism allows organisms to protect themselves and survive when facing oxidative stress.

  Some people might be mind-blown seeing hydrogen peroxide and paraquat mentioned. Can these toxic-sounding substances really extend lifespan? Hydrogen peroxide and paraquat are essentially ROS promoters, so they can act as AMPK activators at appropriate doses. There are indeed hardcore individuals abroad who drink hydrogen peroxide to activate AMPK for anti-aging, but please do not consume paraquat for anti-aging; poor dosage control will be fatal. The paper Inhibition of respiration extends C. elegans’ lifespan via reactive oxygen species that increase HIF-1 activity tested the life-extending effects of paraquat on C. elegans. The paper notes that a mild increase in ROS can stimulate HIF-1 to activate gene expression and promote longevity. The lifespan extension data is shown in the chart:

  The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway is another evolutionarily conserved survival mechanism. When animals experience hypoxia, the HIF signaling pathway is activated, allowing the animal to survive and ultimately extending its lifespan.

  In fact, hypoxia and radiation might be critical conditions that promoted the evolution of longevity genes in animals. Studies have shown that diurnal rodents have longer lifespans, possibly because living during the day exposes them to solar radiation. Radiation causes DNA double-strand breaks, which prompted them to evolve stronger DNA repair capabilities, thereby extending their lifespans. The naked mole-rat is a famous long-lived rodent and a star animal of interest in the anti-aging academic community. Its body size is comparable to a rat's, yet its lifespan is ten times longer. Because naked mole-rats have lived in a low-oxygen environment (underground burrows) for many years, they have evolved a strong capacity to survive in hypoxia. This low-oxygen environment was likely a crucial condition driving the evolution of their longevity genes. It is known that the naked mole-rat has mutations in the HIF-1a and VHL genes. We discussed HIF-1 earlier, and VHL is involved in regulating the response to hypoxia.

  The 2023 paper Hypoxia extends lifespan and neurological function in a mouse model of aging found that hypoxia can extend the lifespan of progeric mice:

> Chronic continuous 11% oxygen starting at 4 weeks of age extends lifespan of Ercc1 Δ/- mice by 50% and delays the onset of neurological debility. Chronic continuous hypoxia did not affect food intake and did not significantly affect DNA damage or senescence markers, suggesting that hypoxia is not simply mitigating the proximal effects of the Ercc1 mutation but acting downstream through an unknown mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that “oxygen restriction” can extend lifespan in a mammalian model of aging.

  (Related data: The air naturally contains about 21% oxygen. The control group in this experiment was exposed to air containing 21% oxygen.)

  This paper provides us with a new anti-aging idea—perhaps holding our breath appropriately every day could help extend our lifespan? However, holding your breath is very difficult to control. Is there a better way to reduce oxygen intake? There is a simple and feasible method: wearing an N95 mask. A paper from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Mask-Induced Cardiopulmonary Stress, found:

> Wearing an N95 mask causes a decrease in respiratory rate and pulse oxygen saturation (Spo2) within 1 hour, and an elevated heart rate after 2 hours (mean change, 3.8 beats/min [95% CI, 2.6-5.1 beats/min]).

  There is a question regarding research on oxygen intake after wearing masks: does the reduction in oxygen intake affect oxygen transport capacity, thereby compensating to improve oxygen transport capacity and making the drop in blood oxygen less obvious? If so, we cannot judge whether masks reduce oxygen intake solely by looking at blood oxygen levels. The Shanghai Jiao Tong University experiment tested heart rate, and obviously, the change in heart rate is related to oxygen intake, which further corroborates the impact of wearing an N95 on oxygen intake. (Of course, this alternative anti-aging method of reducing oxygen intake is merely a theoretical conjecture; please do not try it casually.)

  A more conventional way to activate HIF-1a is through acute endurance training. The decrease in oxygen levels in skeletal muscle during exercise can also activate HIF-1a in skeletal muscle.

  So, are there any drugs or supplements that can increase HIF-1a? Yes. The study Cognitive Enhancer Noopept Activates Transcription Factor HIF-1 shows:

> The effect of noopept (N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester) on HIF-1 DNA-binding activity in SH-SH5Y cells and the mechanism of stabilization of this transcription factor were studied in vitro. It was shown that noopept increases both the basal DNA-binding activity of HIF-1 and its activity induced by various hypoxia mimetics. The mechanism by which noopept stabilizes the oxygen-sensitive HIF1α subunit involves the inhibition of HIF-1 prolyl hydroxylases, which is indirectly indicated by data obtained using an ODD-Luc reporter and positively affects HIF1α protein levels. The results show that the action of noopept is accompanied by changes in gene expression, which belong to different metabolic pathways and are controlled by the transcription factor HIF-1.

  Additionally, the alpine plant Rhodiola rosea has been found to inhibit HIF-1 degradation. Traditionally, Rhodiola is used to treat altitude sickness, and this function is related to its inhibition of HIF-1 degradation. It is possible that Rhodiola, as an alpine plant, also needed to cope with low-oxygen environments and thus evolved anti-hypoxia capabilities itself.

  (It is currently unclear whether noopept and Rhodiola increase ROS or inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Considering this possibility, it is recommended to take them together with AMPK activators.)

  If you want to take ROS-elevating AMPK activators alongside antioxidants for anti-aging, to be safe, you can take the AMPK activator first and then the antioxidant later. Since the activation of AMPK will clear ROS, the ultimate effect is still antioxidant. Once AMPK is activated, taking antioxidants afterwards doesn't matter. So, after taking an AMPK activator, when exactly does AMPK get activated?

  The paper Flavonoids activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase tested the activation time of AMPK by quercetin and kaempferol:

<figure>

<img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-AMPK-05.jpg">

<figcaption>Time course of AMPK activation by quercetin and kaempferol</figcaption>

</figure>

  Chart annotation:

> 3T3L1 preadipocytes were treated with 20 μM quercetin (a) or 20 μM kaempferol (b) for the indicated times. Whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr172) antibody. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control.

  As shown in the figure, when quercetin and kaempferol come into contact with cells, they can activate AMPK within a short period (30 minutes). Once AMPK is activated, we can safely consume antioxidants and ATP-elevating supplements. From the graph, we can also see that the duration of AMPK activation is quite short. After one hour, the amount of phosphorylated AMPK decreases. This is likely because AMPK cannot remain continuously activated; once the conditions that activate AMPK disappear, AMPK phosphorylation quickly returns to normal levels.

  Here is the pharmacokinetic data for some common AMPK activators:

  【Baicalein】

  Data provided by Safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of oral baicalein tablets in healthy Chinese subjects: A single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled multiple‐ascending‐dose study:

  Oral baicalein tablets are rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentration within 2 hours after multiple doses.

  【Luteolin】

  Data provided by Pharmacokinetics of Luteolin and Metabolites in Rats:

> In humans, after a single oral dose of artichoke leaf extract (153.8 mg, containing luteolin-7-O-glucoside; equivalent to 35.2 mg luteolin), the plasma concentration of total luteolin peaked within 0.5 hours, with a maximum level of 156.5 ± 92.29 ng/mL.

  In summary, flavonoid AMPK activators like baicalein and luteolin can quickly enter the bloodstream and activate AMPK after oral administration. Therefore, a safer approach is to take these AMPK activators and wait for a period of time before taking antioxidants. For instance, we could take flavonoid AMPK activators in the morning, and then take antioxidants like NAC, L-glycine, glutathione, and other anti-aging supplements at noon. Alternatively, you could take antioxidants like NAC, L-glycine, glutathione, and other anti-aging supplements in the morning, and take flavonoid AMPK activators before bed (you can arrange the dosing schedule according to your own daily routine).

  Pharmacokinetic data for NAC:

  Data provided by Clinical pharmacokinetics of N-acetylcysteine:

> After an oral dose of 200 to 400 mg of N-acetylcysteine, peak plasma concentrations of 0.35 to 4 mg/L are reached within 1 to 2 hours. Following oral administration, the terminal half-life of reduced N-acetylcysteine is 6.25 hours.

  Based on this data, it can be calculated that 18 hours after oral administration, about 13.3% of NAC remains; 21 hours after oral administration, about 9.7% of NAC remains. At this point, the NAC concentration is low, and its impact on AMPK activators is vastly reduced.

  On the other hand, ATP-reducing AMPK activators may conflict with anti-aging supplements that increase ATP. There are some side effects of ATP-reducing AMPK activators that need to be noted: a decrease in ATP can affect exercise capacity and cause lactic acid accumulation. Common side effects of metformin include limb weakness and muscle soreness. Furthermore, older adults generally have lower baseline ATP levels, so using ATP-reducing AMPK activators like metformin in the elderly might lead to more severe side effects.

  The paper Reconsidering repurposing: long-term metformin treatment impairs cognition in Alzheimer's model mice found:

> We found that metformin enhanced attention, inhibitory control, and associative learning in younger NT mice (≤16 months). However, chronic treatment led to impaired memory and discrimination learning in old age. Furthermore, metformin caused impaired learning and memory in AD mice, alongside increased expression levels of the AMPKα1 subunit, beta-amyloid oligomers, plaques, phosphorylated tau, and GSK3β.

  Meanwhile, resveratrol, which activates AMPK by reducing ATP, failed to achieve the expected results in GlaxoSmithKline's clinical trials, and some patients even experienced kidney failure. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide that provides energy for many processes in living cells, such as muscle contraction, nerve impulse propagation, and chemical synthesis. A reduction in ATP will affect the normal functioning of organs. Energy metabolism disorders exist in chronic kidney disease, and resveratrol may have exacerbated these energy metabolism issues in patients with chronic kidney disease, thereby triggering kidney failure.

  In conclusion, by carefully managing the timing of different supplements, we can reduce conflicts between them and enjoy the benefits of various types of anti-aging supplements.

  **Appendix:**

  Here are a few anti-aging supplement combinations for reference, intended for enthusiasts who might be unsure where to start:

  You can divide anti-aging supplements into an AMPK activator group and an 'other supplements' group, and then take them at staggered intervals. For example:

  【Ergothioneine (Nrf2 activator) / NAC (Antioxidant) / Lithium Orotate (GSK-3β inhibitor)】 + 【Baicalein (AMPK activator)】.

  Combination explanation: Each ingredient in the above combination has a different function. The first three have no mechanistic conflicts and can be taken together; there might even be additive effects. Baicalein (AMPK activator) and NAC (Antioxidant) conflict, so they should not be taken together with the first three.

  Personal experience: I generally take epigenetic modulators (Tranylcypromine, Repsox, CHIR99021, Forskolin, Sodium Valproate, etc.) and antioxidants before breakfast in the morning, and take AMPK activators before bed. This ensures the AMPK activators are effective, because dreaming ability is significantly enhanced after taking them (AMPK activators can increase BDNF, thereby increasing dreaming ability; the specific principles can be found in my article "Mechanisms of Brain Aging and Methods for Reversing Brain Aging").
