&emsp;&emsp;A while ago, research on procyanidin C1 (PCC1) was highly popular in the anti-aging community. Many media outlets reported this news using exaggerated headlines, such as:

&emsp;&emsp;When I saw these kinds of headlines, I suspected it was clickbait. How could a single substance have such a massive life-extending effect? So, I looked up the original paper. I found that the so-called "64.2%" actually meant that the median post-treatment lifespan of the mice was extended by 64.2%. There is a passage in the original text that states:

&emsp;&emsp;Mice receiving PCC1 administration (once every 2 weeks or biweekly) starting at 24–27 months of age (roughly equivalent to an age of 75–90 years in humans) had a 64.2% longer median post-treatment lifespan (or 9.4% longer overall lifespan) and lower mortality hazard (65.0%, P < 0.0001) than the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 8l,m). These data indicate that PCC1 can significantly decrease the risk of age-associated mortality in old mice.

&emsp;&emsp;The actual life-extending effect is: a 9.4% longer overall lifespan.

&emsp;&emsp;This life-extending effect can only be considered decent or passable among the many anti-aging substances out there; it is not particularly miraculous. Let's talk about a recent experiment that demonstrated a rather impressive life-extending effect:

&emsp;&emsp;In June 2021, BioViva published the results of a delayed-aging research project—initiated as early as 2018—on the non-peer-reviewed preprint website bioRxiv. They claimed to have demonstrated for the first time that Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can extend the lifespan of mice through intranasal or injectable gene therapy. Researchers stated that the average lifespan of mice carrying exogenous TERT or FST (MCMVTERT or MCMVFST) in the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) vector was extended by 41.4% and 32.5%, respectively.

&emsp;&emsp;So, what exactly is procyanidin C1 (PCC1) and where does it come from?

&emsp;&emsp;Procyanidins are a general term for a large class of polyphenolic compounds widely found in plants. Structurally, procyanidins are composed of varying numbers of catechin or epicatechin molecules bonded together. The simplest procyanidins are catechins, epicatechins, or dimers formed by catechin and epicatechin. Furthermore, there are trimers, tetramers, and so on, up to decamers. Based on the degree of polymerization, dimers through pentamers are typically referred to as oligomeric proanthocyanidins (OPCs), while those larger than pentamers are called polymeric proanthocyanidins (PPCs). A very common source of procyanidins is grape seeds.

&emsp;&emsp;The specific substance studied in the paper is called procyanidin C1.

&emsp;&emsp;The Fightaging website ([Procyanidin C1 as a Senotherapeutic](https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2021/12/procyanidin-c1-as-a-senotherapeutic/)) summarized the findings of the paper _The flavonoid procyanidin C1 has senotherapeutic activity and increases lifespan in mice_:

&emsp;&emsp;This open access paper runs through a range of data for the assessment of procyanidin C1 as a senolytic compound capable of selectively destroying senescent cells, both in cell studies and in animal studies. Procyanidin C1 clearly isn't as good as dasatinib and quercetin (or fisetin alone) in mice, but it does extend mouse life span by a little under 10%. The mechanism of action appears to involve induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in senescent cells, leading to programmed cell death, but there is a good deal of work remaining in order to fully understand how procyanidin C1 achieves this outcome, and whether or not it is synergistic with other senolytics.

&emsp;&emsp;Translation: This open-access paper evaluates a range of data on procyanidin C1 as a senolytic compound capable of selectively destroying senescent cells, across both cell and animal studies. In mice, procyanidin C1 is clearly not as effective as dasatinib and quercetin (or fisetin alone), but it does extend the lifespan of mice by just under 10%. Its mechanism of action appears to involve the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction in senescent cells, leading to programmed cell death. However, a great deal of work remains to fully understand how procyanidin C1 achieves this outcome and whether it works synergistically with other senolytics.

&emsp;&emsp;Senolytic compounds refer to a class of drugs capable of clearing senescent cells, which includes the combination of dasatinib and quercetin, as well as fisetin. Drugs that clear senescent cells have become a major research hotspot in the anti-aging field in recent years.

&emsp;&emsp;As stated in the paper, the efficacy of procyanidin C1 is inferior to dasatinib and quercetin (or fisetin alone). How should I put it? Quercetin and fisetin supplements are already very common; many people in our community are already taking them.

&emsp;&emsp;Therefore, you shouldn't hold out too much hope for procyanidin C1. First of all, its mechanism is highly replaceable. I wouldn't say it's a dime a dozen, but it's certainly nothing novel. I found a table of Senolytic Compounds here:

&emsp;&emsp;Moreover, as research continues to accumulate, we will likely discover even more molecules capable of clearing senescent cells in the future. So, how do we judge the true value of an anti-aging substance? I propose a few criteria for your reference:

1. Whether its anti-aging pathway is highly specific. There is one particularly ubiquitous pathway in anti-aging: AMPK. A massive number of drugs (like metformin) and supplements (like quercetin and procyanidins) are AMPK activators. Because AMPK activators are highly replaceable, their relative value is comparatively low.
    
2. Whether it is difficult to obtain. Many plant-extracted AMPK activators are readily sold on platforms like Alibaba and can be purchased casually. If it's easy to buy and easy to replace, its value isn't that significant.
    
&emsp;&emsp;Here are a few anti-aging substances that actually carry substantial value:

1. Rapamycin. Rapamycin is a macrolide compound derived from _Streptomyces hygroscopicus_, a microorganism found exclusively on Easter Island. While many AMPK activators have the secondary effect of inhibiting TOR (Target of Rapamycin), rapamycin remains the most potent TOR inhibitor. After all, the target protein is literally named after it.
    
2. ISRIB. ISRIB is a synthetic small molecule invented by Peter Walter's laboratory. It is an integrated stress response (ISR) inhibitor. Current cell and animal experiments have shown that it has functions such as reversing brain aging, enhancing immunity, and preventing long COVID. Because its pathway is quite unique, it is man-made, and there are very few substitute molecules available, it is relatively rare on the market and currently holds significant value.
    
3. Lithium salts. Lithium salts are GSK-3 inhibitors. GSK-3 inhibitors are quite rare—at the very least, they aren't like AMPK activators which can be found in countless herbal ingredients. Although there are a few synthetic GSK-3 inhibitors out there, they are exorbitantly expensive. In contrast, lithium salts are something the average person can actually afford.
    
4. Sodium valproate. This acts as both a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and a GSK-3 inhibitor. It can promote GABAergic function and possesses a sedative effect. Studies have found that the combined use of valproic acid and lithium salts can extend the lifespan of Huntington's disease mice by 30%. Although there are quite a few HDAC inhibitors out there, sodium valproate is very cheap and has multiple functions, making it much harder to replace.
    
5. Glutathione. An essential antioxidant in the human body, it participates in many crucial biochemical reactions. It protects the sulfhydryl groups of vital enzyme proteins from being oxidized and inactivated, ensuring proper energy metabolism and cellular utilization. At the same time, by binding its sulfhydryl groups to free radicals in the body, it directly reduces free radicals into acidic substances, thereby accelerating their excretion and mitigating free radical damage to vital organs. Activating AMPK can provide antioxidant effects by increasing SOD, and many AMPK activators are subsequently dubbed "antioxidants," but glutathione simply cannot be replaced by AMPK activators.
    
6. Astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is an AMPK activator, but it can cross the blood-brain barrier and boasts an antioxidant mechanism independent of AMPK. It has open hydroxyl groups that can rapidly bind with free radicals in the human body to form stable molecular clusters, which are then excreted. This makes it quite exceptional.
