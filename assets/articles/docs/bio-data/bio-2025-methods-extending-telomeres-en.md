 An important protein related to telomere length maintenance is TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase). So, does increasing TERT expression help maintain or lengthen telomeres? Let's look at the relevant experiments:

**Gene Therapy**

  _Transient delivery of modified mRNA encoding TERT rapidly extends telomeres in human cells._ This paper achieved telomere extension in cells by delivering TERT mRNA.

  Gene therapy is still quite distant for the average anti-aging enthusiast. My research frequently involves TERT gene therapy (in an SCI paper I published, I used OSK+TERT for cellular gene therapy, and my good friend Dr. Weike Deng and I also use TERT to create engineered stem cells), but I more highly recommend increasing TERT expression through small molecules. On one hand, small molecules are safer; on the other hand, the cost is lower.

  Here are some small molecules that can increase TERT expression:

  In the paper _Chemically induced reprogramming to reverse cellular aging_, the VC6TF combination was identified as the core component for reversing aging. VC6TF stands for: V: Valproic acid; C: CHIR99021; 6: E-616452 (Repsox); T: Tranylcypromine; F: Forskolin. Several of these can increase TERT expression:

**Tranylcypromine**

  Tranylcypromine is a classic antidepressant used as an LSD1 inhibitor during reprogramming. The paper _Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) Is required for the transcriptional repression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene_ points out that LSD1 inhibits hTERT transcription in normal and cancer cells via demethylation of H3-K4, and collaborates with HDAC to establish a stable repressive state of the hTERT gene in normal or differentiated malignant cells. In cancer cells, inhibiting LSD1 activity or knocking down its expression leads to significantly elevated hTERT mRNA levels and telomerase activity. This paper also tested the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA on hTERT mRNA levels, showing that it can increase hTERT mRNA levels.

**Valproic Acid**

  The paper _Valproic Acid Induces Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Expression during Cortical Development_ found that Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunostaining showed VPA induced an increase in TERT expression in embryonic rat brains and cultured rat primary neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor properties of VPA are responsible for the upregulation of TERT expression.

**CHIR99021**

  CHIR99021 is a potent GSK-3 inhibitor. During the reprogramming process, GSK-3 inhibitors are the main force in increasing TERT expression. CHIR99021 specifically inhibits GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase-3), thereby activating the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, which ultimately promotes the transcription of the TERT gene. Additionally, lithium salts and famotidine are also common GSK-3 inhibitors.

  I started taking the VC6TF combination in 2022. So, how has this combination affected my telomere maintenance? Here are two of my telomere test reports (Xu Qianqian is my real name, Yamu is my screen name):

  As shown in the figures, in the 2021 test report, my relative telomere length was 0.62, surpassing only 37% of my peers, and my cell age was 33.5. In the 2025 test report, my relative telomere length was 1.739, surpassing 84% of my peers, and my cell age was 31.
