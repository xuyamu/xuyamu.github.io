&emsp;&emsp;As everyone knows, memory declines as we age, but why does this happen? An essential mechanism underlying memory is Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). LTP is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity, enabling the synchronous stimulation of two neurons. It is one of several phenomena underlying synaptic plasticity, the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength. Since memory is thought to be encoded by modifications in synaptic strength, LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory. LTP declines with age due to several reasons, including (but not limited to) the following:

**I. Age-related changes in cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling may lead to impairments in synaptic transmission and LTP.**

&emsp;&emsp;The cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription enhancer that plays a crucial regulatory role in neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory. CREB regulates the expression of a protein highly relevant to brain function: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). BDNF is a key member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors. It promotes the survival, differentiation, and growth of dendrites and axons of neurons, playing a particularly critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity—which is essential for the establishment of neural circuits, cognitive functions, and complex behaviors.

&emsp;&emsp;BDNF is vital for maintaining neuronal function. On one hand, it enhances synaptic plasticity, thereby influencing long-term potentiation (LTP); on the other hand, it promotes neurogenesis (especially in the hippocampus) and neuronal survival, particularly for dopamine- and serotonin-related neurons. Here is a pathway diagram illustrating how BDNF affects neuronal function:

&emsp;&emsp;As shown, the activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway ultimately affects neuronal survival, growth, plasticity, BDNF transcription, and LTP through a cascade of cellular signaling.

&emsp;&emsp;Here is a cellular pathway diagram illustrating how cAMP affects CREB expression:

</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;As depicted, when intracellular cAMP levels rise, cAMP binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA, causing a conformational change that releases the active catalytic subunits to phosphorylate their substrates. The CRE-binding protein (CREB1) functions as a transcriptional activator only after being phosphorylated by PKA, MAPK, or CaMK. The paper _Senescent-induced dysregulation of cAMP/CREB signaling and correlations with cognitive decline_ points out that cAMP/CREB signaling changes with aging, which correlates with cognitive decline. Furthermore, according to the paper _Alterations in the balance of protein kinase and phosphatase activities and age-related impairments of synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation_, inhibiting cAMP impairs LTP, while activating cAMP can restore LTP in aged mice.

&emsp;&emsp;Besides cAMP, other factors influence CREB's effects. Here is another diagram illustrating the various pathways that affect CREB:

<figure>

<figcaption>Image Source: Relative contributions of different mechanisms for regulating protein expression</figcaption>

</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;_Image Description:_ The cAMP response element-binding (CREB) protein is pleiotropic. In physiological processes, due to its central position downstream of many growth pathways, CREB signaling has the ability to influence cell survival, growth, and development. From this figure, we can see that NMDA also affects CREB phosphorylation. Notably, the well-known nootropic Noopept acts as an AMPA and NMDA activator.

&emsp;&emsp;Next, let's discuss the role of BDNF in more detail. Here is a BDNF-related signaling pathway diagram:

</figure>

**1. The Relationship Between BDNF Levels, Aging, and Cognitive Ability**

&emsp;&emsp;In the paper _Higher brain BDNF gene expression is associated with slower cognitive decline in older adults_, researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago studied the relationship between BDNF levels and cognitive ability in 535 elderly individuals. They followed up continuously until the participants' deaths (averaging a 6-year follow-up), assessing their cognitive function annually. Post-mortem autopsies were conducted to measure brain BDNF gene expression levels. The results showed that participants with higher brain BDNF levels experienced slower cognitive decline, as shown in the figure:

<figure>

<img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-brain-aging05.jpg">

<figcaption>Image Source: Higher brain BDNF gene expression is associated with slower cognitive decline in older adults</figcaption>

</figure>

**2. The Relationship Between BDNF, Stress, Depression, and Suicide**

&emsp;&emsp;Preclinical models indicate that stress induces the dysregulation of BDNF expression. Several types of stressors have been used to examine the role of BDNF in stress-related illnesses. Exposure to exogenous corticosterone (to mimic stress effects) also decreases BDNF expression in the rodent hippocampus, similar to observations in various preclinical stress models.

&emsp;&emsp;The role of BDNF in depression has garnered widespread attention, as numerous preclinical and clinical studies provide direct evidence that the modulation of BDNF expression may be related to the behavioral phenomena of depression. Furthermore, BDNF expression is altered in the blood cells and post-mortem brain tissues of depressed patients. Genetic studies have also linked BDNF polymorphisms to depression.

&emsp;&emsp;The paper _Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor: Role in Depression and Suicide_ examined specimens from 21 fully characterized suicide subjects and 27 non-psychiatric healthy control subjects, determining BDNF mRNA and protein expression in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC, Brodmann area 9) and the hippocampus. The results showed that BDNF mRNA levels were significantly lower in the PFC and hippocampus of suicide subjects compared to non-psychiatric healthy controls.

**3. The Relationship Between BDNF and Sleep**

&emsp;&emsp;According to the study _Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in sleep-disordered patients: relation to sleep stage N3 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep across diagnostic entities_, low BDNF levels correlate with lower percentages of stage N3 sleep and REM sleep. Additionally, the study _Sleep and aging: 1. Sleep disorders commonly found in older people_ notes that stage N3 and REM sleep decrease in the elderly. Combining these two studies, it is reasonable to deduce that the decline in sleep quality among the elderly may be related to decreased BDNF levels.

**4. The BDNF Gene**

&emsp;&emsp;The BDNF gene rs6265 is a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor gene, classified as:

- The G allele encodes Val (C)
    
- The A allele encodes Met (T)
    

&emsp;&emsp;Each allele is associated with different levels of BDNF secretion. The "CC" genotype produces the most BDNF, "TT" produces the least, and "CT" falls in between.

&emsp;&emsp;Studies show variations in BDNF genotype frequencies among different ethnic groups. About 60-65% of the Caucasian population possesses the "CC" genotype, while this genotype appears in less than 30% of the Chinese population. In contrast, approximately 90% of the Black population has the "CC" genotype—and some African ethnic groups show "CC" genotype proportions as high as 98% (e.g., the Yoruba people).

&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned earlier, BDNF is related to sleep. Does the BDNF gene affect sleep? According to the study _The BDNF Val66Met Polymorphism Modulates Sleep Intensity: EEG Frequency- and State-Specificity_, individuals with the "CC" (homozygous) genotype of BDNF rs6265 experience about 20 more minutes of "slow-wave" sleep (stages 3 and 4) per night. They also show increased overall "sleep intensity" and more alpha EEG activity while awake, as well as more alpha, theta, and sigma EEG activity during REM sleep (compared to the "CT" genotype).

&emsp;&emsp;Some studies have found an association between the BDNF rs6265 genotype and cognitive ability, while others have failed to find strong evidence. Because many genes are involved in cognitive function, the individual impact of the BDNF gene is somewhat limited.

**5. The Relationship Between BDNF and Personality**

&emsp;&emsp;Research has found that COMT and BDNF, acting as modulators of dopamine availability and release in the brain, demonstrate interactive effects on human cognition. According to the study _BDNF Val66Met is Associated with Introversion and Interacts with 5-HTTLPR to Influence Neuroticism_, BDNF modulates multiple neurotransmitter systems, including serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate, and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) is associated with extraversion. Met (T) carriers tend to be more introverted. Numerous studies show that dopamine levels decrease with age. Since BDNF modulates dopamine, age-related changes in cAMP/CREB/BDNF signaling may be a contributing factor to the age-related decline in dopamine levels.

**II. The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) brought on by aging may cause memory impairment. ISR is associated with altered eIF2B function.**

&emsp;&emsp;Eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) is a critical protein involved in eukaryotic translation initiation and also functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. It is a multi-subunit complex comprising five subunits: α, β, γ, δ, and ε. The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) is a central signaling network triggered by disrupted proteostasis, primarily regulating the rate of protein synthesis. This regulation involves the function of the eIF2 ternary complex. The eIF2 ternary complex is a heterotrimer composed of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (comprising α, β, and γ subunits), GTP, and charged methionyl-initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi). Phosphorylation of the α subunit of eIF2 competitively inhibits eIF2B, thereby regulating eukaryotic protein translation. Here is a pathway diagram illustrating how this affects memory and neuronal states:

<figure>

<img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-brain-aging06.jpg">

<figcaption>Image Source: Roles of eIF2α kinases in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease</figcaption>

</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;eIF2α is the α subunit of eIF2. The proteases that modify eIF2α are known as eIF2α kinases, and the phosphorylation of eIF2α impedes protein translation. Currently, four serine/threonine protein kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α have been identified: HRI, PERK, PKR, and GCN2 (as shown above). These four kinases attenuate mRNA translation by phosphorylating the α subunit of eIF2. This attenuation leads to a decrease in phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (p-CREB) levels. As mentioned earlier, CREB is heavily involved in LTP. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of eIF2α also elevates amyloid β-protein (Aβ). As we know, the deposition of neurotoxic Aβ is a major hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

&emsp;&emsp;A paper published in _eLife_ in December 2020, titled _Small molecule cognitive enhancer reverses age-related memory decline in mice_, studied the effects of a compound called ISRIB on the memory of aging mice. The paper discovered that ISRIB can reverse brain aging in mice. ISRIB is an ISR inhibitor—specifically, it functions by antagonizing the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation (often mediated by kinases like PERK). The small molecule ISRIB counteracts the activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) by activating eIF2B, thereby overriding the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2α.

&emsp;&emsp;PKR is also one of the four kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α. Can inhibiting PKR also improve memory? Yes, and there is existing research on this. For instance, in the study _PKR Inhibition Rescues Memory Deficit and ATF4 Overexpression in ApoE ε4 Human Replacement Mice_, researchers injected ApoE4 mice with a PKR inhibitor and found that it rescued memory deficits and attenuated the increased ATF4 mRNA expression in these mice. In another study, _Suppression of PKR Promotes Network Excitability and Enhanced Cognition by Interferon-γ-Mediated Disinhibition_, the authors explored the relationship between PKR and memory. They found that PKR deletion increased late-phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) in hippocampal slices. These effects were caused by a selective reduction in GABAergic synaptic transmission mediated by interferon-γ (IFN-γ). Overall, the findings suggest that PKR regulates network activity that is essential for storing specific episodes during learning. Since PKR activity is altered in several neurological disorders, this kinase represents a promising new target for treating cognitive dysfunction. As a first step in this direction, the study demonstrated that selective PKR inhibitors could replicate the effects seen in PKR-knockout mice.

**III. Epigenetics and Memory**

&emsp;&emsp;We know that all cells in our bodies divide from a single fertilized egg, meaning they all share the identical set of DNA. Yet, different cells have different functions. This occurs because each cell expresses different genes and proteins, resulting in diverse phenotypes. Epigenetic changes primarily manifest as alterations in gene expression and cellular phenotypes without changing the underlying DNA sequence. These changes are driven by epigenetic modifications, which include histone modification and DNA methylation. The CREB-related protein mentioned earlier, CREB-binding protein (CREBBP), is a protein involved in chromatin modification (acting as a histone acetyltransferase).

&emsp;&emsp;As we age, our cells' epigenetics change. Can we reverse this process? Yes, but it requires cellular reprogramming technology. Reprogramming refers to the process of changing a cell's fate by altering epigenetic modifications—such as DNA methylation and acetylation—without changing its genetic sequence. Everyone has heard of cloned animals. How are they created? The cloning process includes a step where the nucleus of an animal's somatic cell is transferred into an enucleated oocyte. During this process, the nucleus undergoes reprogramming.

&emsp;&emsp;In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka from Kyoto University reported the discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) in the prestigious journal _Cell_. They cloned the genes of four transcription factors—Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 (now known as "Yamanaka factors")—into viral vectors and transfected them into mouse fibroblasts. This reprogrammed the fibroblasts into iPS cells, which are similar to embryonic stem cells. In 2012, Yamanaka was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work. So, can we use Yamanaka factors to achieve rejuvenation in living animals? The answer is yes. As early as 2016, researchers at the Salk Institute found that short-term reprogramming could extend the lifespan of progeric mice by 30%. The relevant paper is:

&emsp;&emsp;In Vivo Amelioration of Age-Associated Hallmarks by Partial Reprogramming

&emsp;&emsp;This paper utilized a technique known as "partial reprogramming." This technique achieves localized reprogramming by cyclically and transiently inducing Yamanaka factors. Why must the induction be cyclical and brief? Because continuous, sustained expression of Yamanaka factors would generate tumors in living organisms. A more recent paper published in _Stem Cell Reports_ used a similar approach:

&emsp;&emsp;_In Vivo Reprogramming Ameliorates Aging Features in Dentate Gyrus Cells and Improves Memory in Mice_

&emsp;&emsp;This paper discovered that cyclic reprogramming could reverse cognitive decline in older mice. Directly regulating gene expression through gene therapy is still somewhat distant for the general public (due to issues with cost, safety, etc.). Therefore, using small molecule compounds to reverse brain aging is currently more practical. I will now introduce a few epigenetic-related pathways and how they affect memory:

**1. The Wnt Signaling Pathway**

&emsp;&emsp;The Wnt signaling pathway is a complex network of protein interactions involved in embryonic development, cancer, and normal physiological processes in adult animals. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a critical component of the Wnt pathway. GSK-3 is an evolutionarily highly conserved serine/threonine kinase universally present in mammalian eukaryotic cells. Aside from its originally discovered role in regulating glycogen synthase activity, GSK-3β also acts on numerous signaling proteins, structural proteins, and transcription factors to regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis. The Wnt signaling pathway is closely related to neural development. Let's look at a pathway diagram to see how it influences this process:

<figure>

<img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-brain-aging07.jpg">

<figcaption>Image Source: GSK3 signaling in neural development</figcaption>

</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;As shown, GSK3 can phosphorylate β-catenin. The phosphorylated β-catenin is then ubiquitinated and degraded by the APC complex, preventing it from entering the nucleus to initiate downstream gene transcription. In other words, GSK3 inhibits downstream gene transcription; thus, inhibiting GSK3 can increase the transcription of those genes. Furthermore, GSK3 also downregulates CREB, thereby affecting neuronal function.

&emsp;&emsp;According to the paper _The GSK-3β/β-Catenin Signaling–Mediated Brain–Derived Neurotrophic Factor Pathway Is Involved in Aluminum-Induced Impairment of Hippocampal LTP In Vivo_, the GSK-3β inhibitor SB216763 upregulated the expression of BDNF and β-catenin proteins. In a study examining the efficacy of lithium treatment in AD (Alzheimer's Disease) patients (_Increase of BDNF serum concentration in lithium treated patients with early Alzheimer's disease_), it was found that BDNF serum levels significantly increased in AD patients receiving lithium compared to those receiving a placebo. (Lithium carbonate, a lithium salt, is traditionally used to treat mania.)

**2. Histone Modification**

&emsp;&emsp;Histones are highly alkaline proteins found in eukaryotic cell nuclei that package and order the DNA into structural units called nucleosomes. They are the chief protein components of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA winds, and playing a role in gene regulation. Histone illustration:

<figure>

<img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-brain-aging08.jpg">

<figcaption>Image Source: oryzon</figcaption>

</figure>

&emsp;&emsp;As shown, DNA wraps around histones to form nucleosomes. The core particles of nucleosomes are then linked by linker DNA and histone H1 to form a "beads-on-a-string" chromatin fiber. The chromatin fiber continues to condense, ultimately forming a chromosome. Through this compaction, our DNA can fit inside the tiny cell nucleus.

&emsp;&emsp;Histone modification refers to the processes of methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, adenylation, ubiquitination, and ADP-ribosylation of histones under the action of relevant enzymes. Histone modifications affect gene expression; for example, histone acetylation generally facilitates gene expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) are a class of compounds that interfere with the function of histone deacetylases. By doing so, HDACIs exert epigenetic effects.

&emsp;&emsp;Research has found that HDACIs such as Vorinostat (SAHA), valproic acid, and Trichostatin A (TSA) can induce an increase in BDNF mRNA. It is worth mentioning that cAMP activators, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and GSK-3β inhibitors are frequently used in small-molecule reprogramming. Currently, small molecule compounds can completely replace Yamanaka factors to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. In recent years, both the academic and biohacking communities have begun experimenting with small-molecule reprogramming to reverse aging in vivo. What this field currently needs to explore most are effective and safe drug combinations, delivery methods, and dosages.

&emsp;&emsp;In summary, brain aging involves numerous cellular pathways. To effectively reverse brain aging, multiple pathways need to be modulated simultaneously.

&emsp;&emsp;Incidentally, here are a few common supplements that can help improve memory:

- **Astaxanthin:** An AMPK activator. It possesses both water- and fat-soluble properties, allowing it to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. It delays brain aging by mitigating oxidative stress, ameliorating hippocampal damage, and upregulating BDNF expression.
    
- **Magnesium L-Threonate:** The only magnesium supplement capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. Current research indicates that elevating brain magnesium levels may represent a novel approach to regionally enhancing synaptic plasticity, thereby boosting extinction learning without enhancing or impairing fear memory formation. Elevated brain magnesium increases NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, BDNF expression, presynaptic bouton density, and synaptic plasticity in the PFC.
