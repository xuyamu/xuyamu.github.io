  Currently, there are numerous dietary supplements with potential benefits against COVID-19 that have been verified in clinical trials or animal experiments. This abundance makes it difficult to choose, and changing formulas according to different stages of the illness is also troublesome. So, is there a universal combination plan that can be used daily, pre-infection, during infection, and post-infection? Based on relevant literature and my years of personal experience using dietary supplements, I have summarized the following plan:

**NAD+ Precursors**

  The paper _NAD+ in COVID-19 and viral infections_ points out: "Accumulating evidence suggests that the metabolite NAD+ is a mediator of antiviral and anti-inflammatory mechanisms." This paper discusses the association between low NAD+ concentrations and risk factors for adverse COVID-19 outcomes, including aging and common comorbidities. The paper mentions that compared to the blood of healthy individuals, the blood from patients with severe COVID-19 contains lower levels of NMN, an NAD+ precursor. The paper _Treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia with NAD+ and NMN in two mouse models_, published in _Cell Discovery_ (a Nature sister journal), tested the therapeutic effects of NAD+ and its precursor NMN. It found that NAD+ and NMN can improve pneumonia phenotypes, including excessive inflammatory cell infiltration, hemolysis, and embolism in SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs, and can prevent cell apoptosis. Moreover, NAD+ and NMN treatments can improve the gene expression disorders caused by COVID-19. Furthermore, NMN treatment can reduce the mortality rate of infected aged mice.

**Luteolin**

  Luteolin is a flavonoid abundantly found in the human diet. The paper _The Evaluation of Geroprotective Effects of Selected Flavonoids in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans_ mentions: "Flavonoids are a group of well-studied natural compounds possessing antioxidant, antitumor, antihyperglycemic, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective properties." This study found that luteolin can extend the lifespan of _Caenorhabditis elegans_ and female _Drosophila melanogaster_, demonstrating potential anti-aging effects.

  The paper _Dietary Luteolin Reduces Proinflammatory Microglia in the Brain of Senescent Mice_ notes: "The flavonoid luteolin reduces neuroinflammation and improves learning and memory in aged mice." At the same time, this paper found that a diet supplemented with luteolin inhibits microglia activity in the brain during adult aging and LPS activation, thereby suppressing neuroinflammation.

  The interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is crucial for viral entry and subsequent replication. One study found that when luteolin binds to a previously unidentified distal binding site on the RBD, far from the RBD-ACE2 interface, it exhibits strong allosteric effects. This could be a potential target for future drug discovery.

  Additionally, among SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for viral genome replication and has become one of the most promising targets for drug intervention against SARS-CoV-2. The paper _Quercetin and luteolin are single-digit micromolar inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase_ discovered that luteolin and quercetin possess the ability to inhibit the RdRp enzyme. Luteolin inhibits SARS-CoV-2 RdRp with an IC50 of 4.6 ± 0.3 µM, and quercetin with an IC50 of 6.9 ± 1.0 µM.

  Furthermore, luteolin has the potential to improve brain fog, a common long COVID sequela. _Long-COVID syndrome-associated brain fog and chemofog: Luteolin to the rescue_ points out that long-COVID syndrome symptoms, especially brain fog, are similar to those experienced by patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy, as well as patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). The pathogenesis of brain fog in these diseases is currently unclear, but it may involve neuroinflammation, where mast cells are stimulated by pathogens and stress, releasing mediators that activate microglia and lead to hypothalamic inflammation. These processes can be mitigated by phytosomal preparations of the natural flavonoid luteolin (in olive pomace oil).

  (Luteolin is commonly used as a dietary supplement abroad.)

**Piperine**

  Piperine is an alkaloid extracted from black pepper, pepper roots, and long pepper. It can increase the bioavailability of various active small molecules and is often paired with other dietary supplement ingredients. The paper _Structure-based drug designing for potential antiviral activity of selected natural products from Ayurveda against SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and its cellular receptor_ used molecular docking simulations to discover that piperine interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and the ACE2 receptor.

**Baicalein**

  Baicalein is a flavonoid compound highly concentrated in _Scutellaria baicalensis_ (Chinese skullcap). Baicalein has anti-aging properties. According to DrugAge: The Database of Ageing-related Drugs, baicalein can prolong the mean lifespan of _Drosophila_ by 19.8% and its maximum lifespan by 5.7%.

  _Scutellaria baicalensis_ is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine ingredient; traditional cold remedies like Shuanghuanglian and Xiaochaihu Tang contain it. The US National Library of Medicine's description of baicalein includes "anti-inflammatory agent, plant metabolite, ferroptosis inhibitor, anti-coronavirus agent, SARS coronavirus main protease inhibitor, angiogenesis inhibitor, antineoplastic agent, ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, antibacterial agent, antifungal agent, apoptosis inducer, and anti-aging agent."

  3CLpro, also known as the main protease (Mpro), plays a major role in viral replication. The study _Scutellaria baicalensis extract and baicalein inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its 3C-like protease in vitro_ found that baicalein can inhibit the virus _in vitro_. Its IC50 for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro _in vitro_ is 0.39 µM. (For comparison: the IC50 of PF-07321332 in Pfizer's oral drug Paxlovid for inhibiting Mpro is 0.0192 µM - 0.023 µM).

  According to _The comprehensive study on the therapeutic effects of baicalein for the treatment of COVID-19 in vivo and in vitro_, baicalein significantly inhibited weight loss and viral replication in hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, and alleviated lung tissue damage. Furthermore, in acute lung injury in mice induced by LPS (lipopolysaccharide), baicalein improved respiratory function, inhibited lung inflammatory cell infiltration, and reduced the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the serum.

**Lithium Salts**

  Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase that mediates the addition of phosphate molecules to serine and threonine amino acid residues. In mammals, including humans, GSK-3 exists in two isozymes encoded by two homologous genes, GSK-3α (GSK3A) and GSK-3β (GSK3B). GSK-3 has been the subject of numerous studies because it is associated with a variety of diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, inflammation, cancer, addiction, and bipolar disorder.

  According to the paper _A triple drug combination targeting components of the nutrient-sensing network maximizes longevity_, rapamycin treatment leads to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in patients and mice; this disturbance manifests as hypertriglyceridemia in _Drosophila_. Lithium reversed this, as well as the starvation resistance associated with rapamycin treatment. In this study, the dual combinations of lithium and rapamycin, lithium and trametinib, or rapamycin and trametinib prolonged average lifespan by 30% compared to the control group, whereas each compound individually prolonged lifespan by an average of 11%, and the triple combination prolonged it by 48%.

  Research has found that GSK-3 inhibitors can simultaneously block SARS virus replication while enhancing CD8+ adaptive T cell and innate natural killer (NK) responses. Viral replication requires GSK-3 to phosphorylate critical serine residues on the SARS-CoV N protein, thus small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of GSK-3 can inhibit viral replication. The study _Targeting the coronavirus nucleocapsid protein through GSK-3 inhibition_ conducted a retrospective analysis of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR across three major health systems and found that patients taking lithium had a significantly lower risk of contracting COVID-19.

  According to _Efficacy and Safety of Lithium Treatment in SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients_, lithium can reduce the number of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admission days, as well as the risk of death. By preventing cytokine storms and reducing inflammatory cytokine levels, it may also reduce long COVID syndrome.

  Researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial numbered EudraCT 2020–002008–37 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lithium treatment in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical trial results showed that lithium salt treatment reduced hospital stays; the control group averaged 12.43 days (12.43 ± 12.09), while the lithium salt group averaged 6.47 days (6.47 ± 3.60). The difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.17), but it shows a clear trend of reduced hospital days. None of the patients treated with lithium required ICU admission, and none died. In contrast, in the control group, two patients were admitted to the ICU, and one patient died (Figure 1):

**Sulforaphane**

  The paper _Sulforaphane Targets TRA-1/GLI Upstream of DAF-16/FOXO to Promote C. elegans Longevity and Healthspan_ investigated the effects and mechanisms of sulforaphane in extending the lifespan of _C. elegans_. The paper mentions: sulforaphane, a broccoli-derived isothiocyanate, inhibits inflammation and cancer. The study found that sulforaphane is involved in regulating healthy aging and lifespan extension by inducing the expression and nuclear translocation of TRA-1/GLI and its downstream target DAF-16/FOXO.

  The paper _Sulforaphane exhibits antiviral activity against pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses in vitro and in mice_, published in _Communications Biology_ (a Nature sister journal), investigated the effect of sulforaphane on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The study found that sulforaphane inhibited the _in vitro_ replication of six SARS-CoV-2 virus strains (including Delta and Omicron) as well as the seasonal coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Additionally, sulforaphane and remdesivir act synergistically _in vitro_ to inhibit coronavirus infection. Prophylactic administration of sulforaphane to K18-hACE2 mice prior to intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced viral loads in the lungs and upper respiratory tract, and decreased lung injury and pulmonary pathology compared to untreated infected mice. Sulforaphane treatment reduced immune cell activation in the lungs, including significantly decreasing the recruitment of myeloid cells and reducing T cell activation and cytokine production. The paper noted that sulforaphane should be explored as a potential drug for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus infections.

  (Sulforaphane is a compound found in broccoli and is a very common dietary supplement. Such products are also available domestically.)

**Butyrate, Inulin, and Probiotics**

  Butyric acid is a short-chain fatty acid. A portion of butyric acid in the human body comes from the absorption of butyric acid in food, while the majority comes from gut microbes. Butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor capable of regulating the expression of various genes. Inulin is a soluble dietary fiber and a type of fructan. Inulin is extensively fermented by beneficial bacteria in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), especially butyrate.

  _Supportive therapy during COVID-19: The proposed mechanism of short-chain fatty acids to prevent cytokine storm and multi-organ failure_ states: "The clinical features of patients developing severe COVID-19 consistently suggest a role for gut dysbiosis. These patients share specific risk factors associated with an unhealthy gut microbiome state. Furthermore, COVID-19 infection itself is associated with alterations in the gut microbiome, characterized by the enrichment of opportunistic microbes and the depletion of beneficial commensals. _Faecalibacterium prausnitzii_, a butyrate-producing bacterium, has been found to be depleted in critically ill patients, which is also associated with a pro-inflammatory state."

  This study points out that butyrate suppresses the NF-κB pathway to alleviate inflammation by preventing the proteasomal degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor (i.e., IκB). Moreover, butyrate restores the M1/M2 balance ratio by promoting M2 macrophage polarization through HDAC inhibition and STAT6 signaling pathway activation, thereby suppressing inflammatory responses.

  According to _A New Butyrate Releaser Exerts a Protective Action against SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Human Intestine_, the butyrate releaser butyrin reduces the expression of key molecular mediators of SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory cytokines in _ex vivo_ and _in vitro_ intestinal models.

  The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter cells, and an increase in ACE2 leads to a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The paper _Histone deacetylase inhibitors suppress ACE2 and ABO simultaneously, suggesting a preventive potential against COVID-19_ found through experiments that histone deacetylase inhibitors like sodium butyrate can inhibit ACE2 expression.

  The paper _The influence of a blend of probiotic lactobacillus and prebiotic inulin on the duration and severity of symptoms among individuals with COVID-19_ documents the results of a clinical trial conducted by experts and volunteers from Cambridge University Hospitals (CUH) NHS Foundation Trust, Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and the University of Bedfordshire. The clinical trial found that a specific mixture of _Lactobacillus_ and inulin can improve gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms caused by COVID-19. The study involved 126 people, one-third of whom had an acute COVID infection, and most reported various persistent long-term symptoms lasting more than 100 days. Results analyzed by university statisticians showed that trial participants experienced improvements in cough, fatigue, bowel, and general wellness scores after using the mixture.

**Ganoderma (Reishi Mushroom)**

  Ganoderma, as a precious traditional Chinese medicinal material, is famous for its nourishing functions. The paper _The Role of Ganoderma lucidum Uptake on Some Hematological and Immunological Response in Patients with Coronavirus (COVID-19)_ investigated the impact of Ganoderma on blood indices in COVID-19 patients. The study found that Ganoderma could improve blood parameters such as Hb (hemoglobin), PCV (packed cell volume), RBCs (red blood cell count), and platelets in COVID-19 patients.

  (Common product forms of Ganoderma include Ganoderma spore powder and Ganoderma spore oil.)

**Forskolin**

  Forskolin is a highly effective adenylyl cyclase (cAMP) activator that can stimulate and increase the activity of intracellular adenylyl cyclase in mammalian cells, thereby increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations. Forskolin can combat various neurodegenerative abnormalities by regulating CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

  The paper _Effects of Forskolin on Kupffer Cell Production of Interleukin-10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Differ from Those of Endogenous Adenylyl Cyclase Activators: Possible Role for Adenylyl Cyclase 9_ points out: "The cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway has long been recognized as an important pathway for suppressing TNF-α production, leading to subsequent inhibition of inflammatory responses." The study found that pretreating rat Kupffer cell cultures with an adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin) reduced IL-10 mRNA and protein levels, as well as TNF-α levels.

  _Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) in COVID-19 Patients and its Association with the COVID-19 Manifestations_ points out: Compared to healthy individuals, patients with neurological manifestations have significantly lower BDNF levels, and BDNF levels are significantly negatively correlated with the need for oxygen therapy. This study suggests a crucial link between dysregulated BDNF and hypoxia in promoting COVID-19 manifestations, particularly neurological damage.

  Because forskolin can regulate BDNF levels to exert neuroprotective effects, it might be helpful in combating neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by COVID-19.

  (Forskolin is used as a dietary supplement abroad.)

**Asiaticoside**

  The paper _Interleukin-6 Is a Biomarker for the Development of Fatal Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pneumonia_ points out: "The excessive inflammatory response caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major cause of disease severity and mortality. Several studies have indicated the occurrence of a 'cytokine storm' with the release of Interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-8, as well as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other inflammatory mediators." The release of inflammatory mediators not only plays an important role in the disease progression of COVID-19 but is also involved in the sequelae caused by COVID-19. The study _Interleukin-6 as potential mediator of long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms of COVID-19_ notes: "A majority of COVID-19 survivors develop long-term neuropsychiatric symptoms such as fatigue, sleep difficulties, depression, and anxiety. We propose that neuroimmune crosstalk via inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-6 (IL-6) may exacerbate these long-term COVID-19 symptoms." Therefore, reducing inflammation might help mitigate the harms of COVID-19.

  The paper _Asiaticoside produces an antidepressant-like effect in a chronic unpredictable mild stress model of depression in mice, involving reversion of inflammation and the PKA/pCREB/BDNF signaling pathway_ points out: Asiaticoside treatment upregulated the expression of 5-HT and NE in the CMS (chronic unpredictable mild stress) mouse model. Asiaticoside administration also downregulated the levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α in the hippocampus, and decreased the phosphorylation of nuclear factor (NF)-κBp65 and the expression of nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), thereby reducing the expression of mature caspase-1.

  According to _Asiaticoside delays senescence and attenuates generation of ROS in UV-exposure cells through regulating TGF-β1/Smad pathway_, asiaticoside can attenuate the upregulation of TGF-β1, Smad2, and Smad3, thereby reversing cellular senescence.

  (Asiaticoside is used as a dietary supplement abroad.)

**Shogaol (Ginger, Ginger Tea)**

  The study _Shogaol, Bisdemethoxycurcumin, and Curcuminoid: Potential Zingiber Compounds Against COVID-19_ points out: Curcumin, zingerone, chalcone, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and curcuminoid bind to some active sites of the ACE2 and RdRP proteins. Shogaol interacts with the amino acids of the RdRP and ACE2 proteins. Residues in the Shogaol-RdRP+ACE2 complex indicate that Shogaol blocks the RdRP-ACE2 interaction. Meanwhile, bisdemethoxycurcumin and curcuminoids alter the binding sites of the ACE2 and RdRP proteins. This study suggests that curcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and curcuminoids are potential drugs for preventing COVID-19.

  According to the paper _6-Shogaol attenuates LPS-induced inflammation in BV2 microglia cells by activating PPAR-γ_, 6-shogaol inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and PGE2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, 6-shogaol inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation by suppressing the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Furthermore, 6-shogaol increased the expression of PPAR-γ. Moreover, inhibition of PPAR-γ by GW9662 reversed the suppression of LPS-induced inflammatory mediator production by 6-shogaol. In conclusion, 6-shogaol inhibits LPS-induced inflammation by activating PPAR-γ.

  A clinical trial registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry under number ChiCTR2200059824 investigated whether ginger supplementation could improve the clinical manifestations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The research showed that ginger supplements significantly shortened the hospital stay of COVID-19 patients and pointed out: Bioactive compounds present in ginger, such as gingerol and shogaol, exhibit high affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and therefore may interfere with the interaction between the spike protein and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2).

**Glutathione**

  The paper _The Role of Glutathione in Protecting against the Severe Inflammatory Response Triggered by COVID-19_ points out: The common denominator of all conditions associated with COVID-19 appears to be an impaired redox homeostasis leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); therefore, the level of glutathione (GSH), the key antioxidant guardian in all tissues, is essential for extinguishing the exacerbated inflammation that triggers COVID-19 organ failure. At the same time, glutathione can protect the liver and reduce the risk of drug-induced liver injury.

**Vitamin C**

  Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an antioxidant that helps protect cells from free radicals. Vitamin C has hepatoprotective effects and helps prevent drug-induced liver injury. According to _Vitamin C and its therapeutic potential in the management of COVID19_, Vitamin C has shown preventative effects against COVID-19 in multiple clinical trials.

Liver Protection Recommendation:

**Betaine**

  Betaine is an endogenous substance in the human body, extensively studied for its hepatoprotective effects against alcoholism. According to _Betaine treatment protects liver through regulating mitochondrial function and counteracting oxidative stress in acute and chronic animal models of hepatic injury_, betaine can protect hepatocyte mitochondria in both chronic and acute hepatotoxicity models.
