   (This article is an answer to the Zhihu question: "Why haven't domestically kept immortal jellyfish achieved rejuvenation?")

  Different species of Turritopsis vary greatly in their ability to rejuvenate. Currently, three species are known to have a relatively strong capacity to reverse aging (capable of returning to a juvenile state after reproduction): _Turritopsis dohrnii_ (Chinese name: 多赫灯塔水母, nickname: Immortal jellyfish), _Turritopsis sp.5_, and _Turritopsis sp.2_. Among them, _Turritopsis dohrnii_ possesses the strongest aging-reversal ability. Interestingly, the paper found that _Turritopsis dohrnii_ undergoes reprogramming during the process of reversing aging.

  The paper _Comparative genomics of mortal and immortal cnidarians unveils novel keys behind rejuvenation_ tested the genetic differences across multiple species, specifically comparing the genetic variations between two Turritopsis species: _Turritopsis rubra_ (nickname: Crimson jelly) and _Turritopsis dohrnii_. The study identified a series of gene variants and expansions related to DNA replication, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, redox environment, stem cell populations, and intercellular communication.

  I previously discussed the genetic advantages of long-lived animals in _Analysis of Advantageous Genes in Long-Lived Animals_. When comparing _Turritopsis dohrnii_ with other long-lived animals, a commonality emerges: these organisms all possess genetic advantages in DNA repair and telomere maintenance.

  The paper provides a visual comparison between _Turritopsis rubra_ and _Turritopsis dohrnii_:

  As shown in the image, _Turritopsis rubra_ has a larger, redder manubrium and more tentacles, making it look slightly more ornate. In contrast, _Turritopsis dohrnii_ has a smaller manubrium and fewer tentacles. Let's take a look at the immortal jellyfish raised by Bilibili uploader Old Cu:

<figure> <img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-turritopsis02.jpg"> <figcaption>The immortal jellyfish kept by Old Cu</figcaption> </figure>

  It is quite obvious that the jellyfish kept by Old Cu is definitely not the highly rejuvenative _Turritopsis dohrnii_, but rather closely resembles _Turritopsis rubra_, which has a weaker ability to reverse aging.

  Here are some more photos of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ for comparison:

<figure> <img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-turritopsis04.jpg"> <figcaption>Various stages of Turritopsis dohrnii rejuvenation (Source: María Pascual Torner)</figcaption> </figure>

  This raises a question: if core small-molecule reprogramming cocktails (such as Valproic acid, CHIR99021, RepSox, Tranylcypromine, Forskolin, etc.) were added to the tank of _Turritopsis rubra_, could it help them rejuvenate? This remains to be studied.

  So, are there any Turritopsis species in China capable of restoring their youth after reproducing? I checked, and there actually are. The aforementioned _Turritopsis sp.5_ was discovered in Xiamen. The paper _Ontogeny reversal and phylogenetic analysis of Turritopsis sp.5 (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa, Oceaniidae), a possible new species endemic to Xiamen, China_ describes how _Turritopsis sp.5_ found in Xiamen can also reverse aging. First, researchers sectioned the _Turritopsis sp.5_, cutting the jellyfish in half:

<figure> <img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-turritopsis06.jpg"> <figcaption>The lower half after being sectioned</figcaption> </figure>

  Then, they recorded the reverse development process of _Turritopsis sp.5_:

  The rejuvenation capability of _Turritopsis sp.5_ is slightly weaker than that of _Turritopsis dohrnii_. After being sectioned, the upper half of _T. sp.5_ had a reversal rate of 2.78%, while the lower half had a reversal rate of 15.9%. In comparison, the reversal rate of _T. dohrnii_ is 50-100%.

  This paper provides a phylogenetic tree of Turritopsis:

  From the tree, we can see that _Turritopsis rubra_, which boasts the highest aesthetic appeal, is phylogenetically quite distant from other Turritopsis species.

  The paper _Identification of manubrium pigments in two species of Turritopsis medusae (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa) in Japan_ provides:

  A visual comparison between _Turritopsis rubra_ and _Turritopsis sp._:

  We can observe that _Turritopsis sp._ and its close relative _Turritopsis sp.5_ look quite similar; both have a larger and more pendulous manubrium compared to _Turritopsis dohrnii_.

  I also found a picture of _Turritopsis lata_ and noticed it closely resembles both _Turritopsis sp._ and _Turritopsis sp.5_:

<figure> <img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-turritopsis11.jpg"> <figcaption>Turritopsis lata, size about 4 mm, from Brunswick River, Byron Bay, New South Wales Australia Description</figcaption> </figure>

  These two photos were taken in Brunswick River, Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia.

  In _The complete mitochondrial genome of the hydrozoan jellyfish Turritopsis lata Lendenfeld, 1885 (Cnidaria; Hydrozoa; Anthoathecata) with molecular phylogenetic analysis_, the samples used were collected from Tando Bay, South Korea. The name _Turritopsis lata Lendenfeld, 1885_ implies that an Austrian scholar named Robert von Lendenfeld first described this jellyfish in 1885. Literature research reveals that this jellyfish was originally discovered in New South Wales, Australia.

  This brings up an interesting point: the phylogenetic tree provided in _Ontogeny reversal and phylogenetic analysis of Turritopsis sp.5 (Cnidaria, Hydrozoa, Oceaniidae), a possible new species endemic to Xiamen, China_ does not include the _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld from South Korea or Australia, only _Turritopsis lata Xiamen China_. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the _Turritopsis lata_ from other countries and the _T. sp.5_ from Xiamen are the exact same species. It's highly possible that Xiamen's _T. sp.5_ is actually the introduced _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld rather than a newly discovered endemic species. If _T. sp.5_ is indeed _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld, was the Xiamen _T. sp.5_ brought to Australia before 1885, or was the Australian _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld brought to Xiamen more recently? Obviously, the latter is much more likely, as many ships from Xiamen have historically traveled to New South Wales. Amusingly, the paper even marks the collection site right next to the "Xiamen Port".

  The scenario might have unfolded like this:

  1. At the port of departure (such as Port Jackson in Australia, which is Sydney Harbour, the type locality of _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld): A cargo ship unloads its freight. As the ship becomes lighter, it needs to take in a large amount of seawater as "ballast" to maintain sailing stability. At this moment, thousands of marine microorganisms and plankton (including jellyfish larvae) are sucked into the ballast water tanks.

  2. Transoceanic voyage: The ship turns into a mobile "aquarium," carrying Australian marine life across the ocean.

  3. Arrival at Xiamen Port: The cargo ship needs to load new goods. As the ship becomes heavier, it no longer needs as much ballast water for stabilization. Consequently, it discharges this Australian ballast water, teeming with marine life, directly into the sea at Xiamen Port. This is how _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld likely hitched a ride to Xiamen Port via ballast water.

  4. Scientists from Xiamen University collected a Turritopsis specimen at Xiamen Port and excitedly named it _T. sp.5_, but failed to compare it with Australia's _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld, mistakenly believing they had discovered a new species.

  The paper _A silent invasion_ notes that _Turritopsis dohrnii_ and _Turritopsis rubra_ (native to New Zealand and southern Australia), relying on their robust survival abilities, have invaded various parts of the globe by hitchhiking in ships' ballast water. According to the paper, the closest _Turritopsis dohrnii_ sample to us was collected in Okinawa (and _Turritopsis rubra_ is also found in northern Japan). It remains unknown whether they have invaded the southeastern coastal regions of China. The book _General Outline of Hydrozoa, Cnidaria in China (Vol. 1)_ mentions that a _Turritopsis dohrnii_ sample was collected in Tong'an Bay, Xiamen. However, I suspect that sample might actually be _Turritopsis sp.5_ or _Turritopsis lata_ Lendenfeld. This book was published in 2014, when the classification of Turritopsis was still somewhat chaotic, whereas the paper identifying _Turritopsis sp.5_ was published in 2018. To definitively determine the species of the sample, sequencing is ultimately required. Of course, it could genuinely be _Turritopsis dohrnii_ (which would also highly likely be an invasive population).
