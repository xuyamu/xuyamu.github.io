&emsp;&emsp;Faced with a dazzling array of dietary supplements on the market, how exactly should we choose to maximize the health benefits without spending extra money? As an anti-aging technology researcher and a veteran supplement enthusiast, I have summarized the following experience in selecting ingredients:

&emsp;&emsp;**Refer to cutting-edge research.** There has been a lot of research on anti-aging in recent years. Some studies reveal the mechanisms and anti-aging effects of new substances and drugs, which might be relatively far from our daily application. Other studies investigate the mechanisms and anti-aging effects of older drugs and traditional dietary supplements; this type of research has a much greater guiding role for our daily anti-aging routines.

&emsp;&emsp;**For redundant functions, choosing one is enough.** AMPK activators are a common type of active ingredient in supplements. AMPK (Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase) is a key molecule in the regulation of biological energy metabolism and the core of research on diabetes and other metabolism-related diseases. It is expressed in various metabolism-related organs and can be activated by various bodily stimuli, including cellular stress, exercise, and substances that affect cellular metabolism. Activating AMPK not only regulates bioenergetic metabolism (which can improve high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and high blood lipids) but also has anti-depressant and neuroprotective effects (promoting mitophagy and synthesis, reducing amyloid beta in the brain, increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor <BDNF>, etc.), and can activate the tumor suppressor gene p53 and mechanisms related to telomere extension. Meanwhile, AMPK activators can inhibit the NAD+-consuming enzyme CD38 to increase NAD+ levels and can promote NAMPT, which accelerates the recycling of NAD+. Exercise can also activate AMPK; regularly activating AMPK helps maintain health and extend lifespan. AMPK activators are widely present in living organisms. Different AMPK activators have different activation methods and characteristics, but the mechanisms of many AMPK activators are similar. It is advisable to activate AMPK moderately rather than excessively, as the anti-aging effect of AMPK activation is limited. Taking excessive amounts of AMPK activators will not increase the upper limit of its anti-aging benefits, but may instead affect liver function.

&emsp;&emsp;**Prioritize essential substances for the human body.** Certain endogenous substances contained within the human body have anti-aging functions, and some are important essential substances for the human body. These substances often have some irreplaceable functions. Therefore, when anti-aging mechanisms overlap, we should choose anti-aging substances that are essential to the human body. Resveratrol and quercetin are two common anti-aging substances; both can activate AMPK, but neither is essential for the human body. The human body has several endogenous AMPK activators, such as PQQ, betaine, Coenzyme Q10, and lipoic acid, all of which possess special functions.

&emsp;&emsp;**Select corresponding ingredients based on anti-aging theories.** Mainstream aging theories include factors such as NAD+ level decline, telomere shortening, DNA damage, and epigenetic alterations. We can select targeted anti-aging supplements based on these aging theories. **Prioritize ingredients that protect the liver and kidneys.** Taking certain drugs and supplements will burden liver and kidney metabolism. To avoid potential liver and kidney damage, choose ingredients with hepatoprotective and nephroprotective functions whenever possible.

&emsp;&emsp;**Join anti-aging enthusiast groups and follow anti-aging bloggers to get timely updates.** Join anti-aging enthusiast groups and follow anti-aging bloggers to keep up with developments in the anti-aging field and update your daily anti-aging formula. Below, I recommend an anti-aging formula that protects the liver and kidneys, has non-overlapping functions, uses ingredients essential to the human body, and is easy to obtain:

&emsp;&emsp;**Comprehensive AMPK Activators (PQQ, Betaine, etc.):** PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline quinone) is a prosthetic group of quinoprotein enzymes and participates in electron transport in the respiratory chain. Studies have found that PQQ, along with many other molecules, arrived on Earth billions of years ago with comet dust, prompting nitrogen- and carbon-containing compounds to generate genetic building blocks. Research indicates that PQQ can improve mitochondrial function and is crucial for maintaining fertility. Breast milk contains high levels of PQQ, which is vital for neonatal development, and PQQ can cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby exerting anti-aging effects on neurons. **Betaine** is an endogenous methyl donor in the human body. Human metabolism of NAM consumes methyl donors, and taking NAD+ precursors increases NAM; therefore, taking NAD+ precursors needs to be paired with methyl donors. At the same time, betaine can promote the conversion of NADH to NAD+. Additionally, betaine has the effect of protecting the liver and enhancing fat metabolism (thus aiding in weight loss).

&emsp;&emsp;**NAD+ Precursors like NA and NR:** These are highly popular anti-aging ingredients in recent years. NA and NR are precursors to NAD+. NAD+ is an important coenzyme in the human body, participating in thousands of metabolic reactions. NAD+ declines with age, and numerous studies have found that supplementing with NAD+ precursors helps combat aging.

&emsp;&emsp;**NAC and Glycine:** NAC and glycine are precursors to glutathione, a well-known endogenous antioxidant in the human body. In 2021, an initial 36-week human clinical trial by Baylor College of Medicine in the US found that simultaneously supplementing Glycine and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could comprehensively improve the aging status of octogenarians, with several important aging markers even reversed back to the levels of 21-year-old young adults. In addition, glycine has been found to have life-extending effects in mouse experiments, and NAC also has experimental data showing it extends the lifespan of nematodes. DNA stability is a crucial factor for health and longevity; the mechanism by which glycine and NAC extend lifespan may be related to glutathione reducing free radicals, thereby reducing DNA damage.

&emsp;&emsp;**Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate:** Alpha-ketoglutarate is an important link in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is not only an important metabolic intermediate in the TCA cycle but also a biosynthetic precursor for various amino acids, vitamins, and organic acids in living organisms, such as L-glutamate, L-glutamine, L-proline, and L-arginine. Animal experiments have also demonstrated its oral safety. A paper titled "The ageing epigenome and its rejuvenation" published in the Nature sub-journal _Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology_ in 2020 analyzed the action principles of mainstream life-extension strategies one by one from an epigenetic perspective, mentioning that alpha-ketoglutarate activates two demethylases, JMJD3 and PHF8, thereby extending the lifespan of nematodes. In addition, a paper titled "Alpha-Ketoglutarate, the Metabolite that Regulates Aging in Mice" published in the Cell sub-journal _Cell Metabolism_ in 2020 found that feeding alpha-ketoglutarate to mice could reduce systemic inflammatory cytokine levels. It improved the coat color and hair condition, gait, and kyphosis of female mice, and helped maintain muscle mass, gait, and grip strength in male mice, who also had fewer tumors and better eye health. Furthermore, the lifespans of both male and female mice were extended.
