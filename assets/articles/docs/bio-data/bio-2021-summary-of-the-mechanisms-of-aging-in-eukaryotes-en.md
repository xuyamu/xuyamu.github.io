**The Immortal Bacteria**

&emsp;&emsp;In 2015, an intriguing news story about a Russian scientist injecting himself with an immortal bacterium sparked massive controversy: _Scientist who injected himself with 3.5 MILLION year old germs says they give ETERNAL LIFE_.

&emsp;&emsp;This news referred to a bacterium from the Russian permafrost known as _Bacillus_ sp. strain F. In animal and plant experiments, this bacterium was shown to stimulate growth and enhance immunity. Most miraculously, this bacterium has survived for 3.5 million years—it is practically immortal!

&emsp;&emsp;The vast majority of eukaryotes go through a cycle of birth, aging, illness, and death. Compared to eukaryotes, what makes this bacterium so different? And what causes the aging and death of eukaryotes? There are two very important differences between this bacterium and eukaryotes: first, their DNA is circular, whereas in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA and proteins like histones form chromosome structures, and the ends of these chromosomes have telomeres. Second, bacteria do not have mitochondria, whereas eukaryotes do. So, what are the functions of chromosomes, telomeres, and mitochondria, and how are they related to biological aging and death?

**Mitochondria**

&emsp;&emsp;Mitochondria are organelles found in the cells of most eukaryotes. They possess their own genetic material and genetic system, making them semi-autonomous organelles. There is a hypothesis regarding the origin of mitochondria called the endosymbiotic theory. This theory suggests that the ancestor of mitochondria was an aerobic bacterium, while the ancestor of eukaryotes was a larger organism that did not perform aerobic respiration and obtained energy through glycolysis. After the eukaryotic ancestor engulfed the mitochondrial ancestor, it provided a more suitable living environment for the mitochondrial ancestor, which in turn provided more energy for the eukaryotic ancestor. The two formed a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship.

&emsp;&emsp;What is the advantage of this combination? Glycolysis uses glucose to produce ATP, yielding two molecules of pyruvate and two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Mitochondria, however, via aerobic respiration, can utilize the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation to fully oxidize pyruvate, generating approximately 32 ATP molecules. ATP is the primary source of energy in living organisms and participates in numerous metabolic reactions. More ATP means more energy, and the addition of mitochondria provided a tremendous survival advantage for eukaryotes. Eukaryotes endowed with mitochondria essentially unlocked a "cheat code," eventually evolving into various multicellular organisms, including us humans.

&emsp;&emsp;However, the very mitochondria that supercharged eukaryotes also have a downside: they produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Free radicals have an unpaired solitary electron, making them highly reactive and prone to snatching electrons from elsewhere. Active free radicals can damage DNA and denature proteins. In addition to the free radicals generated by mitochondrial aerobic respiration, factors such as radiation and the ingestion of harmful chemicals also generate free radicals in organisms. The accumulation of free radicals is a key hallmark of aging.

&emsp;&emsp;Do organisms have the ability to combat free radicals? Absolutely. Organisms produce superoxide dismutase (SOD) to scavenge free radicals. SOD is regulated by the FOXO3a protein, and the activation of SOD by FOXO3a requires a deacetylation process involving SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family of histone deacetylases. As we age, sirtuin activity decreases, SOD levels drop, and free radicals cannot be cleared in time, eventually accumulating and leading to aging. Furthermore, research indicates that SIRT1 also plays an important role in mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis (Tang, 2016). In short, the sirtuin family is crucial for mitochondrial health. Let's remember the sirtuin family, as we will further explore the critical role this enzyme family plays in cell growth and aging. It is worth noting that a comparative study of mitochondria in rats and pigeons (White, 2011) found that pigeon mitochondria produce less peroxide, which is a major reason why pigeons live longer than rats.

&emsp;&emsp;Many aging-related diseases are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, neurodegenerative diseases (Johri and Beal, 2012), kidney failure (Bhargava and Schnellmann, 2017), and cardiovascular diseases (Ong and Hausenloy, 2010) are all linked to mitochondrial impairment. Other psychiatric disorders, such as depression (Tobe, 2013), ADHD (Verma et al., 2016), and autism (Giulivi et al., 2010), have also been found to relate to mitochondrial function. Therefore, maintaining mitochondrial function is one of the key factors in sustaining physical and mental health and youthfulness.

&emsp;&emsp;So, what would happen if eukaryotic cells lost their mitochondria? A 2016 study published in _The EMBO Journal_ (Correia-Melo et al., 2016) showed that when mitochondria were removed from aging cells, the cells actually rejuvenated. This experiment decisively confirmed for the first time that mitochondria are significant triggers of cellular senescence.

**Telomeres**

&emsp;&emsp;In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn from the University of California, San Francisco, Carol Greider from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, and Jack Szostak from Harvard Medical School and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering how chromosomes are protected by telomeres and the enzyme telomerase.

&emsp;&emsp;Telomeres are special structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, the telomeres shorten a bit. When telomeres shorten to a certain extent, the cell loses its ability to divide. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase DNA synthesis enzyme that elongates telomeres; in the human body, telomerase is only present in germ cells, stem cells, regenerative somatic cells, and malignant tumor tissues. Telomere length varies among different populations. A 2017 paper published in _Preventive Medicine_, "Physical activity and telomere length in U.S. men and women: An NHANES investigation" (Tucker, 2017), provided a statistical finding: individuals with sustained high levels of physical activity have longer telomeres than those with sedentary lifestyles or moderate activity.

&emsp;&emsp;According to related research (Diman et al., 2016), the mechanism by which exercise elongates telomeres is as follows: exercise consumes ATP, lowering the ATP/AMP ratio, which in turn activates AMPK. AMPK phosphorylates PGC-1α, a coactivator for various transcription factors including NRF1. NRF1 is responsible for regulating the telomere transcription process, and the phosphorylation of PGC-1α relies on SIRT1, a sirtuin family member. Of course, exercise must be moderate; excessively high-intensity exercise can actually harm health. Additionally, comparative experiments between mice with a "super" version of the SIRT1 gene and wild-type mice found that overexpressing SIRT1 can elongate telomeres and delay aging (Bonis et al., 2014).

&emsp;&emsp;A paper published in _Cell Metabolism_ in April 2019, "Telomere Dysfunction Induces Sirtuin Repression that Drives Telomere-Dependent Disease" (Amano et al., 2019), revealed the interaction mechanism between telomeres and the sirtuin family: telomere shortening suppresses the sirtuin family via p53, and the decreased activity of the sirtuin family in turn affects the telomere elongation mechanism. The NAD+ precursor Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) can enhance sirtuin family activity and has been shown in animal experiments to delay telomere shortening.

**AMPK**

&emsp;&emsp;Metformin, originally used as an anti-diabetic drug, has recently been discovered to extend the lifespan of animals (Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013). A paper published in _Nature Communications_ in February 2019, "The flavonoid 4,4′-dimethoxychalcone promotes autophagy-dependent longevity across species" (Carmona-Gutierrez et al., 2019), mentioned that the natural flavonoid compound DMC (4,4'-dimethoxychalcone) can extend the lifespan of fruit flies and nematodes. Prior to this, Chinese scientists also found that baicalein extends the lifespan of fruit flies. Metformin, chalcone, and baicalein share a common function—they are all AMPK activators.

&emsp;&emsp;AMPK (Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase) is a critical molecule in the regulation of biological energy metabolism. Widely present in various organisms from bacteria to humans, AMPK acts as an organism's self-preservation mechanism under stress. When intracellular ATP levels drop, 5'-AMP interacts with the γ subunit of AMPK to activate it. Furthermore, AMPK can also be activated by LKB1 (the primary upstream kinase of AMPK) phosphorylating it, or by CAMKK2 (Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2) phosphorylating the threonine 172 residue on the α subunit.

&emsp;&emsp;Activating AMPK has numerous benefits. It not only stimulates hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis while inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, lipogenesis, and triglyceride synthesis, but it also suppresses adipocyte lipolysis and lipogenesis. Moreover, it stimulates skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and muscle glucose uptake, and regulates insulin secretion.

&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned earlier, exercise can activate AMPK. Various natural AMPK activators exist in plants, and some are also found in animals, such as betaine, Coenzyme Q10, PQQ, and lipoic acid.

**Stem Cells**

&emsp;&emsp;Bacteria proliferate through division. Interestingly, some bacteria seem to use asymmetric division to reproduce. For example, a flagellated bacterium called _Caulobacter crescentus_ uses asymmetric division to produce offspring; only one of the two daughter cells inherits the flagellum. The daughter cell with the flagellum can swim in liquid, while the one without can continue to divide and reproduce.

&emsp;&emsp;Stem cells, on the other hand, have two modes of division (Shahriyari and Komarova, 2013): symmetric cell division and asymmetric cell division. Through symmetric division, a stem cell can expand its numbers by dividing into two stem cells or differentiate into two differentiating cells. Through asymmetric division, a stem cell divides into two daughter cells with different fates: one remains a stem cell, and the other becomes a differentiating cell.

&emsp;&emsp;Research indicates (Katajisto et al., 2015) that the daughter cell destined to remain a stem cell receives a higher portion of young mitochondria. If compounds are used to disrupt the allocation of old and new mitochondria during division, preventing this asymmetric distribution, the daughter cell will lose its stem cell characteristics. From this, we can hypothesize: a stem cell can only produce two daughter cells with identical stem cell traits via expansion when its mitochondrial function is robust.

&emsp;&emsp;A paper published in _Cell Death & Disease_ in April 2019, "Nicotinamide mononucleotide promotes osteogenesis and reduces adipogenesis by regulating mesenchymal stromal cells via the SIRT1 pathway in aged bone marrow" (Song et al., 2019), showed that supplementing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with the NAD+ precursor NMN can improve their expansion capacity, and this capacity is linked to NMN enhancing SIRT1 expression. As mentioned previously, SIRT1 can enhance mitochondrial function by promoting mitophagy and biogenesis. The enhanced expansion capacity of MSCs after NMN supplementation is likely related to improved mitochondrial function. In summary, stem cell function is also heavily reliant on the sirtuin family.

&emsp;&emsp;It is worth mentioning that primordial germ cells also produce sperm and eggs through asymmetric division (Kimata et al., 2016). Eggs contain a vast number of mitochondria, while sperm contain relatively few. This might explain why the upper age limit for reproduction in females is lower than in males—eggs require more healthy mitochondria, and mitochondrial function deteriorates with age.

**The Sirtuin Family**

&emsp;&emsp;Mitochondria, telomeres, stem cells, and our aging are inextricably linked. Based on our previous summaries, the sirtuin family plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of mitochondria, telomeres, and stem cells.

&emsp;&emsp;Sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) is a class of highly conserved histone deacetylases widely found in eukaryotes from bacteria to humans. The Sirtuin protein family is involved in epigenetic processes and can regulate the acetylation and ADP-ribosylation of various proteins. The mammalian Sirtuin family consists of seven members. Among them, SIRT1, SIRT6, and SIRT7 are primarily located in the nucleus; SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are mainly located in mitochondria; and SIRT2 is primarily distributed in the cytoplasm. These seven proteins are involved in regulating cellular stress responses, metabolism, aging, and apoptosis.

&emsp;&emsp;Sirtuins carry out Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylation reactions, thereby participating in epigenetic modifications. However, NAD+ levels decline with age. Ultimately, the deacetylation activity of sirtuins weakens, marking a critical step in the aging of eukaryotes. We have already listed how several sirtuin-dependent deacetylation mechanisms affect mitochondria, telomeres, and stem cells. Notably, related research (Ruderman et al., 2010) shows a mutual regulatory relationship between the sirtuin family member SIRT1 and AMPK, meaning a decrease in SIRT1 acetylation levels will lead to a decline in AMPK activation.

&emsp;&emsp;There is a fascinating animal called the naked mole rat. They are not visually appealing, but they have an exceptionally long lifespan compared to other rodents. For instance, mice typically live for only three years, whereas naked mole rats can live up to 32 years. Recent studies have found (Tian et al., 2019) that naked mole rats have robust SIRT6 activity, which grants them strong DNA repair capabilities and ultimately extends their lifespan.

**Coenzyme NAD+**

&emsp;&emsp;As mentioned, the sirtuin family is vital for the health and survival of eukaryotes, and NAD+ is a necessary molecule for the sirtuin family's deacetylation processes. So, just how important is NAD+? If we examine the human metabolic map (Virtual Metabolic Human), we find that NAD+ is extensively involved in various metabolic reactions. Notably, NAD+ is a coenzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle within eukaryotic mitochondria and also participates in glycolysis. The ATP generated by the TCA cycle and glycolysis provides the most fundamental energy for biological survival. Because NAD+'s influence is so widespread, a decline in its levels inevitably affects the quality of a eukaryote's survival. Therefore, NAD+ can be considered a pivotal molecule in the eukaryotic aging process.

&emsp;&emsp;According to relevant research (Imai and Guarente, 2014), the decline in NAD+ levels involves at least the following factors:

1. Increased levels of the NAD+-consuming enzyme CD38.
    
2. Chronic inflammation leading to a decrease in nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). NAMPT is responsible for converting NAM to NMN, and NMN is then converted to NAD+ by nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT).
    
3. DNA damage leading to the activation of PARP, a DNA repair enzyme that consumes NAD+.
    

&emsp;&emsp;Research has discovered that some AMPK activators, such as apigenin, can inhibit CD38 (Escande et al., 2013). Furthermore, activating AMPK can raise NAMPT levels, thereby increasing NAD+ levels (Fulco et al., 2008). This is one of the mechanisms by which activating AMPK extends eukaryotic lifespan.

&emsp;&emsp;During their lifespan, eukaryotes inevitably suffer from chronic inflammation and DNA damage due to various issues, meaning the decline in NAD+ levels is unavoidable. Thus, the vast majority of eukaryotes will inevitably march toward aging and death. To pass on their genes, eukaryotes achieve genetic immortality by separating new parts from the aging whole and discarding the aged sections. For mammals, the offspring leave the mother with an abundance of new mitochondria, elongated telomeres, and healthy cells to start anew, while the mother, burdened with aged cells, shortened telomeres, and senescent mitochondria, continues to age. The _Turritopsis dohrnii_ (immortal jellyfish) achieves immortality by continuously reverting to its polyp stage; I speculate that during this process, the immortal jellyfish sheds its senescent cells.

**Future Prospects**

&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the NAD+ precursors NMN and NR, which are already sold as anti-aging supplements, other agents currently proven in experiments to increase NAD+ levels include the NQO1 enhancer KL1333, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) inhibitors (Neelakantan et al., 2019), ACMSD inhibitors (which control the _de novo_ synthesis pathway of NAD+) (Katsyuba et al., 2018), and Dihydronicotinamide riboside (Yang et al., 2019), an NAD+ precursor significantly more potent than NMN and NR. Used individually, these agents can achieve a certain degree of rejuvenation. If used in combination to drastically increase NAD+ levels, the results could be astonishing.

&emsp;&emsp;As previously mentioned, telomeres regulate the Sirtuin family, which is closely related to aging, and SIRT1 initiates the telomere elongation mechanism. Therefore, if we massively increase intracellular NAD+ levels to enhance SIRT1 activity, could we significantly elongate telomeres? Once telomeres are elongated, can the telomere trimming mechanism (Rivera et al., 2016) be promptly activated to prevent them from becoming excessively long? Additionally, raising NAD+ too high might produce side effects, such as generating an excess of ATP through the TCA cycle, which could promote androgen synthesis. Excessive androgens could lead to issues like increased body hair and acne breakouts (though androgens can be regulated pharmacologically). Currently, no one has conducted animal experiments combining all NAD+-boosting agents. No one knows what bizarre things might happen if a mature mammal's NAD+ levels are drastically elevated.

&emsp;&emsp;One day, 2.3 billion years ago, eukaryotes emerged on Earth (Gold et al., 2017). Initially, eukaryotes were just single-celled organisms capable of engulfing and digesting food. Today, eukaryotes exist on Earth in a vast array of forms and a rich diversity of appearances. Since their emergence 2.3 billion years ago, virtually no eukaryote has escaped the fate of aging and death. The student surpasses the master; if the parent generation never dies, the offspring will never have a chance to thrive. The genetic recombination brought about by eukaryotic sexual reproduction, along with biological aging and death, are perhaps essential for eukaryotic evolution.

&emsp;&emsp;However, for humans of the future, aging and death may no longer be evolutionary necessities. Because in the future, we may be able to alter our biological essence by modifying our own bodies and genes, rather than relying on the uncertain genetic mutations and recombinations brought by reproduction to shape our future.

&emsp;&emsp;Aging has long been considered a natural process. As _Homo sapiens_ with a lifespan of merely a hundred years or so, we are incredibly insignificant compared to the vast universe. Curiosity and the desire to explore drive humanity to continually push beyond our limits. Perhaps in the near future, we will be able to cure aging and even conquer death. A world without aging and death will be an entirely new world for us.
