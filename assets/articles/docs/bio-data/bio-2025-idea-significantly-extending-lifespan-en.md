  Regarding the question of why current biotechnology cannot significantly extend lifespan, we can explore clues from two perspectives:

  **The Advantages of Long-Lived Animals**

  1. What genetic advantages and longevity mechanisms do long-lived animals possess? By understanding their genetic advantages and longevity mechanisms, we might uncover some key mechanisms of aging.

  2. What are the life-extending mechanisms of existing anti-aging technologies? We can examine whether the life-extending mechanisms of current anti-aging technologies can simulate the longevity mechanisms of long-lived animals.

  I previously introduced the genetic advantages of long-lived species such as Brandt's bat, naked mole-rats, bowhead whales, giant tortoises, and human centenarians in the following article:

  [Analysis of Advantageous Genes in Long-Lived Animals (Link)](https://xuyamu.com/dossier.html?id=bio-2021-analysis-of-advantageous-genes-in-long-lived-animals)

  In this article, I introduced the genetic advantages of _Turritopsis dohrnii_, which can reverse aging:

  [Miscellaneous Discussions on Immortal Jellyfish (Link)](https://xuyamu.com/dossier.html?id=bio-2025-notes-on-the-turritopsis-dohrnii-jellyfish)

  For _Turritopsis dohrnii_ (Chinese translation: 多赫灯塔水母, nickname: Immortal jellyfish), the paper _Comparative genomics of mortal and immortal cnidarians unveils novel keys behind rejuvenation_ tested genetic differences across multiple species, comparing the genetic differences between _Turritopsis rubra_ (nickname: Crimson jelly) and _Turritopsis dohrnii_. The paper identified a series of gene variations and amplifications related to gene replication, DNA repair, telomere maintenance, the redox environment, stem cell populations, and intercellular communication. Interestingly, during the process of _Turritopsis dohrnii_ reversing aging, pluripotency-associated genes such as NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and MYC are highly expressed. This indicates that _Turritopsis dohrnii_ undergoes reprogramming during its age-reversal process.

  Based on the aforementioned research on various long-lived animals, it is easy to discover that they generally share the following commonalities:

  Robust telomere maintenance functions, exceptional DNA repair capabilities, strong anti-cancer abilities, and powerful antioxidant capacities.

  The paper _DNA repair and anti-cancer mechanisms in the long-lived bowhead whale_ compared the expression levels of CIRBP and several other gene repair enzymes in the cells of mice, cows, humans, and bowhead whales. According to the Western blot (WB) results, humans have multiple highly expressed gene repair-related proteins (such as DNAPKcs, Ku80, Ku70, etc.), but the expression level of CIRBP in bowhead whales far exceeds that of mice, cows, and humans. The study found that the high expression of CIRBP is associated with the bowhead whale's exceptional gene repair capacity, and overexpressing bowhead whale CIRBP in human cells improved their gene repair ability. The paper also investigated the tumor suppressor genes of the bowhead whale and found that, compared to mice, cows, and humans, the basal activity of p53 in bowhead whale cells is the lowest, whereas the strong anti-cancer ability of elephants is related to the amplification of their p53 gene. Therefore, the bowhead whale's resistance to cancer mainly relies on its strong gene repair ability; its genes are less prone to mutation, so its cells naturally resist becoming cancerous.

  Through the charts in this paper, we can see significant differences in gene repair efficiency among different species:

<figure>     <img src="assets/articles/images/bio-data/bio-different-dna-repair.webp">     <figcaption>a, b. Measurement of NHEJ and HR repair efficiency using fluorescent reporter vectors.</figcaption> </figure>

  The two gene repair mechanisms mentioned in the figure are:

  Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ): NHEJ is the primary DSB (double-strand break) repair pathway in mammalian cells. It directly ligates broken DNA ends without requiring any template.

  Homologous Recombination (HR): This process uses an intact homologous DNA strand (usually a sister chromatid) as a "blueprint" to precisely copy missing or damaged genetic information.

  So, how do animals with limited individual lifespans ensure the long-term continuation of their populations? If we view the germline as a whole, it is, in a sense, immortal. To ensure the fidelity of genetic information and the continuation of the species, the germline has evolved a DNA damage repair and quality control system that is more efficient, higher in fidelity, and more multi-layered than most somatic cells. Why do germ cells possess stronger gene repair capabilities? One significant factor is the absence of the DREAM complex in meiotic germ cells. The paper _The DREAM complex functions as conserved master regulator of somatic DNA-repair capacities_ points out that the DREAM complex transcriptionally represses almost all DNA repair systems, thereby acting as a highly conserved master regulator that limits somatic DNA repair capacity. Inhibiting the DREAM complex in human cells enhances the expression of DNA repair genes and resistance to various types of DNA damage.

  The review _Changes in DNA repair during aging_ compares DNA repair mechanisms between young and old individuals. The paper notes: "All DNA repair pathways, including MMR, excision repair, and DSB repair, become inefficient with age, leading to an accumulation of mutations." (Therefore, our anti-aging efforts are, in a way, aimed at making our cells younger so they possess stronger gene repair capabilities, thereby slowing down the rate of mutation accumulation).

  In sexually reproducing animals, when germ cells are still young and have not accumulated too many mutations, they undergo reprogramming through fertilization to return to the initial state of life. In this way, the germline is passed down from generation to generation, achieving a form of immortality. Thus, the germline seems somewhat similar to the immortal jellyfish, achieving immortality through a relatively stable genome (while gene mutations are inevitable, germ cells must maintain normal cellular function to continuously transmit information) and continuous reprogramming.

  So, if a mammal's entire body of cells possessed exceptional genomic stability and underwent continuous reprogramming, could that mammal achieve immortality? This is a fascinating hypothesis.

  Why, then, haven't most animals evolved super-strong gene repair capabilities across all their somatic cells? Reasons include, but are not limited to:

  1. Gene repair is highly energy-consuming. Processes like damage recognition, chromatin remodeling, DNA unwinding, DNA synthesis, and DNA ligation all consume large amounts of ATP. Animals with strong gene repair capabilities need to guarantee sufficient food intake. Without this condition, evolving super-strong gene repair abilities is impossible.

  2. As long as animals can pass down their genetic information, the continuation of the population is maintained. Super-strong gene repair capabilities are not a prerequisite for species continuation.

  How did animals with strong gene repair capabilities evolve them? Environmental pressure might be the reason. The CIRBP protein is a cold-induced mRNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role when cells face various stresses such as low temperature, hypoxia, and radiation. Its primary functions include stabilizing the cell by stabilizing transcripts critical for cell survival and inhibiting cell proliferation under cold conditions. Additionally, it participates in the assembly of stress granules and plays an important role in the genotoxic stress response. The bowhead whale lives in the frigid Arctic; its extraordinarily high expression of the CIRBP protein might have evolved precisely to cope with this cold Arctic environment.

  Let's look at the lifespan data of the bowhead whale and its close relatives: The bowhead whale lives in waters ranging from -2°C to 5°C and can live over 200 years; the southern right whale lives in 0°C to 20°C waters, with a median lifespan of about 73 years, and 10% can live past 132 years; the North Pacific right whale lives in 5°C to 17°C waters; while the North Atlantic right whale has an average lifespan of only 22 years, with only 10% of individuals likely to live past 47 years.

  The paper _The bowhead whale_, published in the Journal of Mammalogy in 1993, provides feeding data for the bowhead whale: "Each whale requires 433-2102 kg of food per day." The massive head of the bowhead whale (accounting for one-third of its body length) and the longest baleen in the world (up to 4 meters) clearly contribute to efficient hunting:

  **Limitations of Existing Technologies**

  Around 2022, I conducted a fruit fly life-extension experiment (the data was not published as a paper because, for various reasons, the data was not detailed enough, which is regrettable). In this experiment, a combination of small molecule epigenetic modulators I designed was able to extend the average lifespan of female fruit flies by 56%. However, I discovered a problem: the small molecule epigenetic modulators have a "ceiling effect." That is, after the life-extension magnitude reaches a certain point, we cannot further improve the effect by adding more small molecules. This might be because the life-extension pathways are already saturated, and repeatedly targeting the same pathway cannot yield further improvements. The paper _Chemically induced reprogramming to reverse cellular aging_, published in 2023, identified the VC6TF combination as the core component for reversing aging. VC6TF stands for: V: Valproic acid; C: CHIR99021; 6: E-616452 (RepSox); T: Tranylcypromine; F: Forskolin. This paper also found that small molecule combinations have a ceiling effect. I have extensive experience in the use of small molecule compounds. In 2022, I explored oral administration methods for epigenetic modulators, including VC6TF (this combination requires pairing with various adjuvants to reduce side effects, thereby achieving the effect of reversing aging without harming health), and successfully used these small molecules to significantly reverse my biological age (using Aging.ai to predict biological age based on medical examination indicators; unfortunately, the Aging.ai website is currently offline). Additionally, my telomeres were extended during my active anti-aging process. In a 2021 test report, my relative telomere length was 0.62, outperforming only 37% of my peers, with a cellular age of 33.5. In a 2025 test report, my relative telomere length was 1.739, outperforming 84% of my peers, with a cellular age of 31. I introduced several small molecule compounds capable of boosting telomerase reverse transcriptase, along with my telomere test reports, in my Zhihu article _Several Methods for Maintaining or Extending Telomeres_.

  So, how do we significantly extend lifespan? For example, how do we increase the life-extension magnitude to 100%, allowing a mouse with a lifespan of only two-plus years to live to five or ten years? As discussed earlier, long-lived species possess three major advantages: robust telomere maintenance functions, exceptional DNA repair capabilities, and strong anti-cancer abilities. If we want to significantly extend the lifespan of a short-lived species, these three capabilities must at least be improved.

  Genome instability is one of the crucial hallmarks of aging. As cells age, they continuously accumulate genetic mutations, which causes changes in cellular function, senescence, and, in severe cases, carcinogenesis. The paper _Tissue-specific mutation accumulation in human adult stem cells during life_ found that human adult stem cells in the small intestine, colon, and liver tissues accumulate about 40 new mutations per year.

  If we carefully examine a series of aging hallmarks and explore their potential improvement methods, we will find that the core small molecule compounds for reprogramming can already resolve most of them. For instance, regarding epigenetic alterations, the core small molecules of reprogramming are used precisely to reverse the epigenetic clock. Cellular senescence is also closely related to epigenetic alterations; for example, senescent cells form SAHF (Senescence-Associated Heterochromatin Foci) and exhibit global changes in histone modifications. To address telomere attrition, tranylcypromine, valproic acid, and CHIR99021 can increase the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase. Specifically:

  Tranylcypromine is a classic antidepressant used as an LSD1 inhibitor in reprogramming. The paper _Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) Is required for the transcriptional repression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene_ points out that LSD1 inhibits the transcription of hTERT in normal and cancer cells by demethylating H3K4, and it cooperates with HDACs to establish a stable repressive state of the hTERT gene in normal or differentiated malignant cells. In cancer cells, inhibiting LSD1 activity or knocking down its expression leads to a significant increase in hTERT mRNA levels and telomerase activity. This paper also tested the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA on hTERT mRNA levels, showing that it can increase hTERT mRNA levels.

  The paper _Valproic Acid Induces Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase Expression during Cortical Development_ found through Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunostaining that VPA induced an increase in TERT expression in embryonic rat brains and cultured primary rat neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor properties of VPA are responsible for the upregulation of TERT expression.

  CHIR99021 is a potent GSK-3 inhibitor. During reprogramming, GSK-3 inhibitors are the main force driving the increase in TERT expression. By specifically inhibiting GSK-3 (Glycogen synthase kinase-3), CHIR99021 activates the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, ultimately promoting the transcription of the TERT gene. Additionally, lithium salts and famotidine are common GSK-3 inhibitors.

  Regarding chronic inflammation, tranylcypromine and RepSox exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Specifically:

  Inhibiting LSD1 has an anti-inflammatory effect. A paper published in the Nature subsidiary journal Cell Death & Disease, _The histone demethylase LSD1 promotes renal inflammation by mediating TLR4 signaling in hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis_, states: "Renal inflammation significantly promotes the progression of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN). Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) was significantly upregulated in the renal tissues of patients with HBV-GN, and its expression positively correlated with inflammation. Functionally, LSD1 promoted the release of proinflammatory mediators in HBV-induced HK-2 cells, a human renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cell line. Mechanistic studies showed that LSD1 directly promoted the transcription of the inflammation-related gene TLR4 by erasing the mono- or dimethylation of H3K9 near its promoter. Knockdown of LSD1 further inhibited the TLR4-NF-κB/JNK signaling cascade, subsequently reducing the production of proinflammatory mediators in HBV-induced HK-2 cells. Meanwhile, downregulating the aforementioned TLR4-related pathways with small-molecule inhibitors alleviated inflammation. The LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP) repressed the TLR4-NF-κB/JNK signaling axis and alleviated renal inflammation in HBV-transgenic mice." Meanwhile, RepSox, as an ALK5 inhibitor, acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by blocking the TGF-β signaling pathway.

  Stem cell exhaustion can be resolved by improving the self-renewal capacity of stem cells, and reprogramming can indeed enhance this capacity. RepSox can elevate Nanog, a transcription factor associated with stem cell self-renewal.

  Forskolin, acting as an AMPK activator, can ameliorate the deregulated nutrient-sensing hallmark of aging. It is known that rapamycin cannot stack an age-reversing effect on top of the VC6TF combination, which suggests that the VC6TF combination already covers the age-reversing effects of mTOR inhibition. Therefore, the aging hallmark of disabled macroautophagy, which is related to mTOR, can also be ameliorated by the VC6TF combination.

  Altered intercellular communication is linked to increased inflammatory signaling, hormonal dysregulation, neurotransmitter imbalance, and blunted or excessive cellular responses. The VC6TF combination also helps improve this aging hallmark; its anti-inflammatory functions have already been discussed. The paper _Neuromodulatory Effect of G s- or G q-Coupled G-Protein-Coupled Receptor on NMDA Receptor Selectively Activates the NMDA Receptor/Ca2+/Calcineurin/cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein-Regulated Transcriptional Coactivator 1 Pathway to Effectively Induce Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Expression in Neurons_ indicates that forskolin treatment can increase Bdnf-eIV mRNA expression in cortical cells. BDNF can enhance synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis. The study _Body composition and hormonal adaptations associated with forskolin consumption in overweight and obese men_ shows that serum free testosterone levels were significantly elevated in the men in the forskolin treatment group. Furthermore, the study _Forskolin-stimulated vasopressin and oxytocin release from the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system in vitro is inhibited by melatonin_ points out that forskolin can stimulate the release of vasopressin and oxytocin from the rat hypothalamo-neurohypophysial (H-NH) system.

  Regarding mitochondrial dysfunction, GSK-3β regulates mitochondrial biogenesis, bioenergetics, permeability, motility, and apoptosis. Theoretically, CHIR99021, as a GSK-3β inhibitor, can improve mitochondrial function, while forskolin's activation of the cAMP signaling pathway can also activate PGC-1α to promote mitochondrial biogenesis.

  So, what can the core small molecules of reprogramming _not_ do? This combination cannot give a cell gene repair capabilities that surpass its species' limits. We cannot reverse a mouse's epigenetics to grant it the robust gene repair abilities of a human; at most, we can restore its gene repair capacity to a younger state. This explains why we cannot significantly extend animal lifespans through partial reprogramming alone. Then how do we equip an animal with gene repair abilities beyond its species' limit? On the one hand, we can overexpress gene repair-related enzymes via gene therapy; on the other hand, a small molecule approach involves designing allosteric activators to stimulate gene repair enzymes or developing molecular glues to stabilize gene repair-related complexes. Perhaps in the near future, drugs targeting gene repair will become as hot a topic as cancer drugs.

  Among the hallmarks of aging, they can be categorized by their degree of reversibility/amelioration:

  T0: Genomic instability (mutations are irreversible). This cannot be reversed with existing technologies (we cannot edit mutated sites on a massive scale).

  T1: Epigenetic alterations (requires gene therapy or small molecule reprogramming), telomere attrition (can be lengthened by certain specific small molecules), and stem cell exhaustion (requires reprogramming to enhance self-renewal). These can be ameliorated with current tech, but it requires "strong medicine" (gene therapy or small molecule epigenetic modulators).

  T2: Loss of proteostasis (can be improved by inhibiting ER stress, e.g., using ISRIB or luteolin), disabled macroautophagy (can be improved by activating AMPK, inhibiting mTOR, etc.), deregulated nutrient-sensing (can be improved by activating AMPK, inhibiting mTOR, etc.), mitochondrial dysfunction (can be improved by activating AMPK, inhibiting GSK-3, etc.), cellular senescence (can be improved by clearing senescent cells, reprogramming, reducing inflammation, etc.), altered intercellular communication (can be improved by reducing inflammation; some epigenetic modulators alter neurotransmitter and hormone levels, e.g., forskolin increases oxytocin and monoamine secretion and elevates dopamine D2 receptor levels), and chronic inflammation (many anti-aging small molecules reduce inflammation; for example, various dietary supplement AMPK activators have anti-inflammatory effects, prescription drugs like pirfenidone and ursodeoxycholic acid do too, and reprogramming core components like forskolin, tranylcypromine, and RepSox are quite effective). The above hallmarks are relatively easy to ameliorate with small molecule compounds.

  Since gene mutations are irreversible (barring gene editing), the earlier we enhance our gene repair capabilities and reduce gene mutations, the more beneficial it is for lifespan extension. Therefore, for those who want to significantly extend their lives, anti-aging efforts should start early.
