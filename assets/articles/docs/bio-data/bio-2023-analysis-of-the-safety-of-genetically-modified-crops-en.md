&emsp;&emsp;Today, we discussed the safety of genetically modified (GM) crops in our group chat. Here, I will provide a series of analyses on this issue.

　　Question: Will the transposable elements (transposons) in GM corn jump into humans and genetically modify us?

　　Answer: There is no evidence indicating that the inserted genes will turn into transposons and jump out. Moreover, even if the inserted genes did turn into transposons and jump out, transposons already account for about 50% of the human genome and 90% of the corn genome. Would a few extra transposons added to corn really make a difference? Besides, plant transposons are DNA fragments; can they even enter your bloodstream?

　　Question: Will the extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) from GM crops enter human cells and cause adverse effects?

　　Answer: There are three mechanisms of eccDNA biogenesis.

　　(A) The "chromothripsis" model: Chromothripsis involves the generation of DNA double-strand breaks. The DNA repair machinery ligates the fragments together in a random order and orientation. The new chromosomes may contain complex structural rearrangements and structural variations. (B) The episome model: Bidirectional DNA replication results in two replication forks, with the region between them forming a replication bubble. When an error occurs during replication, the replication forks collapse, causing the replication bubble to fall off and form an episome shape. These can be amplified through replication and recombination to form eccDNA. (C) The translocation-excision-deletion-amplification model: Gene translocations occur near chromosomes. Fragments adjacent to the translocation site can be amplified, deleted, and circularized, thereby generating eccDNA.

　　The formation of eccDNA is a probabilistic event. Whether a plant forms eccDNA has nothing to do with whether it contains artificial sequences. The corn genome size can be as large as 2.5 Gb, while you usually only insert a few genes during genetic modification. A single gene is typically just a few kb (transcribed into mRNA to synthesize a protein with a specific function), which accounts for a very small proportion. The random errors forming eccDNA from artificial sequences would not exceed the amount of eccDNA formed from the plant's natural sequences, unless your artificial sequence is specifically prone to falling out. Furthermore, plant eccDNA would have to enter your bloodstream to have a profound impact on your cells. The likelihood of DNA from food entering the bloodstream is extremely low, and even if it does, it survives for a very short time. We eat plants and animals every day; if their eccDNA could easily enter the human body and cause harm, how could we still eat them?

　　Question: Will the plant overexpression plasmids used for transfection enter the human body?

　　Answer: Plasmid replication requires an origin of replication (ori). Plasmids amplified in bacteria use prokaryotic origins of replication. Plants cannot replicate these overexpression plasmids on their own; the plasmids must integrate into the plant genome to be replicated and passed on. Plasmids exist for a very short time, so it is impossible for the GM plants you eat to contain the overexpression plasmids used for the initial transformation.

　　Question: GM plants are transformed using _Agrobacterium_. Will the T-DNA carrying the target gene integrate into human genes?

　　Answer: There are many naturally transgenic plants created by _Agrobacterium_. If you aren't afraid of the natural ones, why fear the artificial ones? A million years ago, the sweet potato genome was naturally transformed by _Agrobacterium_. So many mammals eat sweet potatoes, and humans have eaten them for many years, yet no bacterial gene remnants have been found in the mammalian genome (though there are many remnants of ancient viruses).

　　The conditions for T-DNA to integrate into your genome are extremely harsh: T-DNA must be escorted by two bacterial proteins as a single-stranded DNA-protein complex (T-complex) to transfect the plant and integrate the target gene. Therefore, you would need to eat the GM plant, eat the _Agrobacterium_, and absorb the _Agrobacterium_ proteins. Then, the modified T-DNA from the GM plant would have to perfectly reach your cells, and the _Agrobacterium_ proteins would have to escort this modified T-DNA into your body and integrate it into your genome. Proteins denature when heated, so you would have to eat the _Agrobacterium_ raw. Moreover, proteins are broken down into various amino acids in the digestive tract, and DNA is also degraded. The probability of either the T-DNA or the escort proteins reaching your cells intact is incredibly low. The entry of foreign DNA and proteins into the human body is a very low-probability event, and entering through the digestive tract makes it virtually impossible. If T-DNA could integrate into the mammalian genome, mammals would have been heavily genetically modified by _Agrobacterium_ long ago. Some mammalian ancestors lived underground and ate roots and stems, inevitably consuming plenty of _Agrobacterium_. If mammals could be genetically modified simply by eating _Agrobacterium_, their bodies would contain a massive amount of T-DNA.

　　Also, GM soybeans and corn are already widely used in animal husbandry to feed pigs. If GM plants affected the health and fertility of pigs, do you think farmers would still feed them to their livestock?

　　Question: Will the miRNAs from GM crops enter the human body and cause harm?

　　Answer: miRNAs will not alter your genes unless they undergo reverse transcription. Reverse transcription requires reverse transcriptase, and specific reverse transcriptases transcribe specific RNAs. Plant miRNAs entering the human body will not be reverse-transcribed and integrated into your genome. There is indeed a small amount of evidence suggesting that plant miRNAs can enter the bloodstream, but their impact has not yet been thoroughly studied. GM crops usually have protein-coding genes inserted, which are transcribed into mRNA. If plant mRNA could enter human cells, your cells would produce plant proteins. This could trigger an immune response, or even give you plant characteristics, turning you into a "plant-person"—which is highly unlikely.
